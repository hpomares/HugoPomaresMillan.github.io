### About me ðŸ‘‹
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with expertise in genetic epidemiology, public health, and regulatory and medical affairs. My work centers on studying exposomics, including lifestyle factors, and assessing health risks in genetically predisposed populations. I am dedicated to translating findings from genetic epidemiology into clinical practice with a focus on public health. My research leverages large-scale population studies, GWAS data, and advanced machine-learning techniques in epidemiology. My specific interest lies in Precision Medicine, and I have collaborated with the ADA/EASD Precision Diabetes Initiative, as well as EU-funded projects like IMI-DIRECT and SOPHIA.

Iâ€™m currently working on GxE: a gene-environment interaction between genetic susceptibility and arsenic exposure using polygenic scores (PGS) associated with bladder cancer and xenobiotic metabolism.
