	doi = {10.1136/bmj.i2156},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of body mass index (BMI) and the risk of all cause mortality, and to clarify the shape and the nadir of the dose-response curve, and the influence on the results of confounding from smoking, weight loss associated with disease, and preclinical disease.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase databases searched up to 23 September 2015.
STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies that reported adjusted risk estimates for at least three categories of BMI in relation to all cause mortality.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Summary relative risks were calculated with random effects models. Non-linear associations were explored with fractional polynomial models.
RESULTS: 230 cohort studies (207 publications) were included. The analysis of never smokers included 53 cohort studies (44 risk estimates) with {\textgreater}738 144 deaths and {\textgreater}9 976 077 participants. The analysis of all participants included 228 cohort studies (198 risk estimates) with {\textgreater}3 744 722 deaths among 30 233 329 participants. The summary relative risk for a 5 unit increment in BMI was 1.18 (95\% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.21; I(2)=95\%, n=44) among never smokers, 1.21 (1.18 to 1.25; I(2)=93\%, n=25) among healthy never smokers, 1.27 (1.21 to 1.33; I(2)=89\%, n=11) among healthy never smokers with exclusion of early follow-up, and 1.05 (1.04 to 1.07; I(2)=97\%, n=198) among all participants. There was a J shaped dose-response relation in never smokers (Pnon-linearity {\textless}0.001), and the lowest risk was observed at BMI 23-24 in never smokers, 22-23 in healthy never smokers, and 20-22 in studies of never smokers with ≥20 years' follow-up. In contrast there was a U shaped association between BMI and mortality in analyses with a greater potential for bias including all participants, current, former, or ever smokers, and in studies with a short duration of follow-up ({\textless}5 years or {\textless}10 years), or with moderate study quality scores.
CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity is associated with increased risk of all cause mortality and the nadir of the curve was observed at BMI 23-24 among never smokers, 22-23 among healthy never smokers, and 20-22 with longer durations of follow-up. The increased risk of mortality observed in underweight people could at least partly be caused by residual confounding from prediagnostic disease. Lack of exclusion of ever smokers, people with prevalent and preclinical disease, and early follow-up could bias the results towards a more U shaped association.},

Here, we aimed to gain insights into the genetic architecture of biomarker traits which can reflect health status. We performed genome-wide association analyses for twenty serum biomarkers involved in organ function and reproductive health. 9,961 individuals from the UK Household Longitudinal Study were genotyped using the Illumina HumanCoreExome array and variants imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project and UK10K haplotypes. We establish a polygenic heritability for all biomarkers, confirm associations of fifty-four established loci, and identify five novel, replicating associations at genome-wide significance. A low-frequency variant, rs28929474, (beta = 0.04, P = 2 × 10-10) was associated with levels of alanine transaminase, an indicator of liver damage. The variant is located in the gene encoding serine protease inhibitor, low levels of which are associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency which leads to liver disease. We identified novel associations (rs78900934, beta = 0.05, P = 6 × 10-12; rs2911280, beta = 0.09, P = 6 × 10-10) for dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate, a precursor to major sex-hormones, and for glycated haemoglobin (rs12819124, beta = -0.03, P = 4 × 10-9; rs761772, beta = 0.05, P = 5 × 10-9). rs12819124 is nominally associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.

In general, the use of meta-analysis has been increasing over the last three decades with mental health as a major research topic. It is then essential to well understand its methodology and interpret its results. In this publication, we describe how to perform a meta-analysis with the freely available statistical software environment R, using a working example taken from the field of mental health.
METHODS: R package meta is used to conduct standard meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses for missing binary outcome data and potential selection bias are conducted with R package metasens. All essential R commands are provided and clearly described to conduct and report analyses.
RESULTS: The working example considers a binary outcome: we show how to conduct a fixed effect and random effects meta-analysis and subgroup analysis, produce a forest and funnel plot and to test and adjust for funnel plot asymmetry. All these steps work similar for other outcome types.
CONCLUSIONS: R represents a powerful and flexible tool to conduct meta-analyses. This publication gives a brief glimpse into the topic and provides directions to more advanced meta-analysis methods available in R.},

Key differences are identified in a wide range of traits, including cardiovascular mortality, fat distribution, liver metabolism, blood pressure, specific lipid fractions and blood levels of proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodelling. We find marginal differences in abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes bacteria in the gut. Instrumental analyses reveal prominent causal roles for waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure and cholesterol content of high-density lipoprotein particles in the development of diabetes in obesity.

Using in silico perturbations, we identified drug-omics associations across the multi-modal datasets for the 20 most prevalent drugs given to people with type 2 diabetes with substantially higher sensitivity than univariate statistical tests. From these, we among others, identified novel associations between metformin and the gut microbiota as well as opposite molecular responses for the two statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin.

	doi = {10.1016/S2213-8587(22)00340-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 receptor agonists lower blood glucose concentrations, body weight, and have cardiovascular benefits. The efficacy and side effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists vary between people. Human pharmacogenomic studies of this inter-individual variation can provide both biological insight into drug action and provide biomarkers to inform clinical decision making. We therefore aimed to identify genetic variants associated with glycaemic response to GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment.
METHODS: In this genome-wide analysis we included adults (aged ≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists with baseline HbA1c of 7\% or more (53 mmol/mol) from four prospective observational cohorts (DIRECT, PRIBA, PROMASTER, and GoDARTS) and two randomised clinical trials (HARMONY phase 3 and AWARD). The primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction at 6 months after starting GLP-1 receptor agonists. We evaluated variants in GLP1R, then did a genome-wide association study and gene-based burden tests.
FINDINGS: 4571 adults were included in our analysis, of these, 3339 (73\%) were White European, 449 (10\%) Hispanic, 312 (7\%) American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 471 (10\%) were other, and around 2140 (47\%) of the participants were women. Variation in HbA1c reduction with GLP-1 receptor agonists treatment was associated with rs6923761G→A (Gly168Ser) in the GLP1R (0·08\% [95\% CI 0·04-0·12] or 0·9 mmol/mol lower reduction in HbA1c per serine, p=6·0 × 10-5) and low frequency variants in ARRB1 (optimal sequence kernel association test p=6·7 × 10-8), largely driven by rs140226575G→A (Thr370Met; 0·25\% [SE 0·06] or 2·7 mmol/mol  [SE 0·7] greater HbA1c reduction per methionine, p=5·2 × 10-6). A similar effect size for the ARRB1 Thr370Met was seen in Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native populations who have a higher frequency of this variant (6-11\%) than in White European populations. Combining these two genes identified 4\% of the population who had a 30\% greater reduction in HbA1c than the 9\% of the population with the worse response.
INTERPRETATION: This genome-wide pharmacogenomic study of GLP-1 receptor agonists provides novel biological and clinical insights. Clinically, when genotype is routinely available at the point of prescribing, individuals with ARRB1 variants might benefit from earlier initiation of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Linear mixed models were used to assess the average associations of lifestyle exposures and linear regression models were used to test associations with 10-year change in the cardiometabolic traits. 'Physical activity' and 'General Health' were the exposure categories containing the highest number of 'tentative signals' in analyses assessing the average association of lifestyle variables, while 'Tobacco use' was the top category for the 10-year change association analyses. Eleven modifiable variables showed a consistent average association among the majority of cardiometabolic traits. These variables belonged to the domains: (i) Smoking, (ii) Beverage (filtered coffee), (iii) physical activity, (iv) alcohol intake, and (v) specific variables related to Nordic lifestyle (hunting/fishing during leisure time and boiled coffee consumption). We used an agnostic, data-driven approach to assess a wide range of established and novel risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. Our findings highlight key variables, along with their respective effect estimates, that might be prioritised for subsequent prediction models and lifestyle interventions.},

In this longitudinal study, participants (N = 2,111) underwent a 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and 48 months. HbA1c was also measured. We classified participants as having isolated prediabetes defect (impaired fasting glucose [IFG], impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], or HbA1c indicative of prediabetes [IA1c]), two defects (IFG+IGT, IFG+IA1c, or IGT+IA1c), or all defects (IFG+IGT+IA1c). β-Cell function (BCF) and insulin sensitivity were assessed from OGTT. At baseline, in pooling of participants with isolated defects, they showed impairment in both BCF and insulin sensitivity compared with healthy control subjects. Pooled groups with two or three defects showed progressive further deterioration. Among groups with isolated defect, those with IGT showed lower insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion at reference glucose (ISRr), and insulin secretion potentiation (P {\textless} 0.002). Conversely, those with IA1c showed higher insulin sensitivity and ISRr (P {\textless} 0.0001). Among groups with two defects, we similarly found differences in both BCF and insulin sensitivity. At 48 months, we found higher type 2 diabetes incidence for progressively increasing number of prediabetes defects (odds ratio {\textgreater}2, P {\textless} 0.008). In conclusion, the prediabetes groups showed differences in type/degree of glucometabolic impairment. Compared with the pooled group with isolated defects, those with double or triple defect showed progressive differences in diabetes incidence.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the processes underlying glycemic deterioration in type 2 diabetes (T2D).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 732 recently diagnosed patients with T2D from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Diabetes Research on Patient Stratification (IMI DIRECT) study were extensively phenotyped over 3 years, including measures of insulin sensitivity (OGIS), β-cell glucose sensitivity (GS), and insulin clearance (CLIm) from mixed meal tests, liver enzymes, lipid profiles, and baseline regional fat from MRI. The associations between the longitudinal metabolic patterns and HbA1c deterioration, adjusted for changes in BMI and in diabetes medications, were assessed via stepwise multivariable linear and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Faster HbA1c progression was independently associated with faster deterioration of OGIS and GS and increasing CLIm; visceral or liver fat, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides had further independent, though weaker, roles (R 2 = 0.38). A subgroup of patients with a markedly higher progression rate (fast progressors) was clearly distinguishable considering these variables only (discrimination capacity from area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.94). The proportion of fast progressors was reduced from 56\% to 8-10\% in subgroups in which only one trait among OGIS, GS, and CLIm was relatively stable (odds ratios 0.07-0.09). T2D polygenic risk score and baseline pancreatic fat, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucagon, diet, and physical activity did not show an independent role.
CONCLUSIONS: Deteriorating insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, increasing insulin clearance, high visceral or liver fat, and worsening of the lipid profile are the crucial factors mediating glycemic deterioration of patients with T2D in the initial phase of the disease. Stabilization of a single trait among insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and insulin clearance may be relevant to prevent progression.},

	abstract = {The serum metabolome contains a plethora of biomarkers and causative agents of various diseases, some of which are endogenously produced and some that have been taken up from the environment1. The origins of specific compounds are known, including metabolites that are highly heritable2,3, or those that are influenced by the gut microbiome4, by lifestyle choices such as smoking5, or by diet6. However, the key determinants of most metabolites are still poorly understood. Here we measured the levels of 1,251 metabolites in serum samples from a unique and deeply phenotyped healthy human cohort of 491 individuals. We applied machine-learning algorithms to predict metabolite levels in held-out individuals on the basis of host genetics, gut microbiome, clinical parameters, diet, lifestyle and anthropometric measurements, and obtained statistically significant predictions for more than 76\% of the profiled metabolites. Diet and microbiome had the strongest predictive power, and each explained hundreds of metabolites-in some cases, explaining more than 50\% of the observed variance. We further validated microbiome-related predictions by showing a high replication rate in two geographically independent cohorts7,8 that were not available to us when we trained the algorithms. We used feature attribution analysis9 to reveal specific dietary and bacterial interactions. We further demonstrate that some of these interactions might be causal, as some metabolites that we predicted to be positively associated with bread were found to increase after a randomized clinical trial of bread intervention. Overall, our results reveal potential determinants of more than 800 metabolites, paving the way towards a mechanistic understanding of alterations in metabolites under different conditions and to designing interventions for manipulating the levels of circulating metabolites.},

Here we report a causal inference analysis investigating the effects of prediabetes in coronary artery disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease, complemented by a systematic review of relevant observational studies. Although the observational studies suggest that prediabetes is broadly associated with diabetes complications, the causal inference analysis revealed that prediabetes is only causally related with coronary artery disease, with no evidence of causal effects on other diabetes complications. In conclusion, prediabetes likely causes coronary artery disease and its prevention is likely to be most effective if initiated prior to the onset of diabetes.},

The project was initiated in 2018 by reviewing the literature on the reporting of instrumental variable and MR studies. A group of 17 experts, including MR methodologists, MR study design users, developers of previous reporting guidelines, and journal editors, participated in a workshop in May 2019 to define the scope of the Statement and draft the checklist. The draft checklist was published as a preprint in July 2019 and discussed on the preprint platform, in social media, and at the 4th Mendelian Randomization Conference. The checklist was then revised based on comments, further refined through 2020, and finalized in July 2021.The STROBE-MR checklist is organized into 6 sections (Title and Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Other Information) and includes 20 main items and 30 subitems. It covers both 1-sample and 2-sample MR studies that assess 1 or multiple exposures and outcomes, and addresses MR studies that follow a genome-wide association study and are reported in the same article. The checklist asks authors to justify why MR is a helpful method to address the study question and state prespecified causal hypotheses. The measurement, quality, and selection of genetic variants must be described and attempts to assess validity of MR-specific assumptions should be well reported. An item on data sharing includes reporting when the data and statistical code required to replicate the analyses can be accessed.STROBE-MR provides guidelines for reporting MR studies. Improved reporting of these studies could facilitate their evaluation by editors, peer reviewers, researchers, clinicians, and other readers, and enhance the interpretation of their results.},

Here we present the OpenGWAS database, an open source, open access, scalable and high-performance cloud-based data infrastructure that imports and publishes complete GWAS summary datasets and metadata for the scientific community. Our import pipeline harmonises these datasets against dbSNP and the human genome reference sequence, generates summary reports and standardises the format of results and metadata. Users can access the data via a website, an application programming interface, R and Python packages, and also as downloadable files that can be rapidly queried in high performance computing environments.
OpenGWAS currently contains 126 billion genetic associations from 14,582 complete GWAS datasets representing a range of different human phenotypes and disease outcomes across different populations. We developed R and Python packages to serve as conduits between these GWAS data sources and a range of available analytical tools, enabling Mendelian randomization, genetic colocalisation analysis, fine mapping, genetic correlation and locus visualisation.

	abstract = {Oxysterols are cholesterol metabolites generated in the liver and other peripheral tissues as a mechanism of removing excess cholesterol. Oxysterols have a wide range of biological functions, including the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism, platelet aggregation, and apoptosis. However, it has been found that metabolites derived from cholesterol play essential functions in cancer development and immunological suppression. In this regard, research indicates that 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) might act as an estrogen, promoting the growth of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cells. The capacity of cholesterol to dynamically modulate signaling molecules inside the membrane and particular metabolites serving as signaling molecules are two possible contributory processes. 27-HC is a significant metabolite produced mainly through the CYP27A1 (Cytochrome P450 27A1) enzyme. 27-HC maintains cholesterol balance biologically by promoting cholesterol efflux via the liver X receptor (LXR) and suppressing de novo cholesterol production through the Insulin-induced Genes (INSIGs). It has been demonstrated that 27-HC is able to function as a selective ER regulator. Moreover, enhanced 27-HC production is in favor of the growth of end-stage malignancies in the brain, thyroid organs, and colon, as shown in breast cancer, probably due to pro-survival and pro-inflammatory signaling induced by unbalanced levels of oxysterols. However, the actual role of 27-HC in cancer promotion and progression remains debatable, and many studies are warranted to be performed to unravel the precise function of these molecules. This review article will summarize the latest evidence on the deleterious or beneficial functions of 27-HC in various types of cancer, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma, thyroid cancer, adrenocortical cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.},

	abstract = {Despite its success in achieving the long-term survival of 10–30\% of treated individuals, immune therapy is still ineffective for most patients with cancer1,2. Many efforts are therefore underway to identify new approaches that enhance such immune ‘checkpoint’ therapy3–5 (so called because its aim is to block proteins that inhibit checkpoint signalling pathways in T cells, thereby freeing those immune cells to target cancer cells). Here we show that inhibiting PCSK9—a key protein in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism6–8—can boost the response of tumours to immune checkpoint therapy, through a mechanism that is independent of PCSK9’s cholesterol-regulating functions. Deleting the PCSK9 gene in mouse cancer cells substantially attenuates or prevents their growth in mice in a manner that depends on cytotoxic T cells. It also enhances the efficacy of immune therapy that is targeted at the checkpoint protein PD1. Furthermore, clinically approved PCSK9-neutralizing antibodies synergize with anti-PD1 therapy in suppressing tumour growth in mouse models of cancer. Inhibiting PCSK9—either through genetic deletion or using PCSK9 antibodies—increases the expression of major histocompatibility protein class I (MHC I) proteins on the tumour cell surface, promoting robust intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. Mechanistically, we find that PCSK9 can disrupt the recycling of MHC I to the cell surface by associating with it physically and promoting its relocation and degradation in the lysosome. Together, these results suggest that inhibiting PCSK9 is a promising way to enhance immune checkpoint therapy for cancer.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for estimating the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome using a genetic factor as an instrumental variable (IV) for the exposure. In the traditional MR setting, data on the IV, exposure, and outcome are available for all participants. However, obtaining complete exposure data may be difficult in some settings, due to high measurement costs or lack of appropriate biospecimens. We used simulated data sets to assess statistical power and bias for MR when exposure data are available for a subset (or an independent set) of participants. We show that obtaining exposure data for a subset of participants is a cost-efficient strategy, often having negligible effects on power in comparison with a traditional complete-data analysis. The size of the subset needed to achieve maximum power depends on IV strength, and maximum power is approximately equal to the power of traditional IV estimators. Weak IVs are shown to lead to bias towards the null when the subsample is small and towards the confounded association when the subset is relatively large. Various approaches for confidence interval calculation are considered. These results have important implications for reducing the costs and increasing the feasibility of MR studies.},

Here we show the effects of an LXR agonist on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and neutrophils in human subjects. BMS-852927, a novel LXRβ-selective compound, had favorable profiles in animal models with a wide therapeutic index in cynomolgus monkeys and mice. In healthy subjects and hypercholesterolemic patients, reverse cholesterol transport pathways were induced similarly to that in animal models. However, increased plasma and hepatic TG, plasma LDL-C, apoB, apoE, and CETP and decreased circulating neutrophils were also evident. Furthermore, similar increases in LDL-C were observed in normocholesterolemic subjects and statin-treated patients. The primate model markedly underestimated human lipogenic responses and did not predict human neutrophil effects. These studies demonstrate both beneficial and adverse LXR agonist clinical responses and emphasize the importance of further translational research in this area.},

	abstract = {The interplay between cellular stress and immune response can be variable and sometimes contradictory. The mechanisms by which stress-activated pathways regulate the inflammatory response to a pathogen, in autoimmunity or during cancer progression remain unclear in many aspects, despite our recent knowledge of the signalling and transcriptional pathways involved in these diseases. In this context, over the last decade many studies demonstrated that cholesterol metabolism is an important checkpoint for immune homeostasis and cancer progression. Indeed, cholesterol is actively metabolized and can regulate, through its mobilization and/or production of active derivatives, many aspects of immunity and inflammation. Moreover, accumulation of cholesterol has been described in cancer cells, indicating metabolic addiction. The nuclear receptors liver-X-receptors (LXRs) are important regulators of intracellular cholesterol and lipids homeostasis. They have also key regulatory roles in immune response, as they can regulate inflammation, innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, activation of LXRs has been reported to affect the proliferation and survival of different cancer cell types that show altered metabolic pathways and accumulation of cholesterol. In this minireview we will give an overview of the recent understandings about the mechanisms through which LXRs regulate inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer, and the therapeutic potential for future treatment of these diseases through modulation of cholesterol metabolism.},

	abstract = {The oxysterol receptors [liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ)] regulate cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis and several studies link dysregulation of these metabolic pathways to aberrant cell growth. Here, we show that activation of LXR significantly reduced proliferation in several human breast cancer cells lines. LXR suppressed messenger RNA and/or protein expression of Skp2, cyclin A2, cyclin D1 and estrogen receptor (ER) α, whereas it increased the expression of p53 at the protein level and maintained the retinoblastoma protein in a hypophosphorylated active form. These changes may constitute part of the molecular mechanisms behind the antiproliferative effect of LXR. Furthermore, activation of LXR induced expression of key lipogenic genes including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), fatty acid synthase and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1, leading to increased triglyceride production in MCF7 cells. Small interfering RNA knockdown of SREBP1c, a master regulator of the lipid biosynthesis, did not abolish the antiproliferative effect of LXR in these cells. Combined these studies identify LXRs as both antiproliferative and lipogenic factors in breast cancer cells and indicate that the antiproliferative effect of LXRs is independent of lipid biosynthesis.},

Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element–binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.},

To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for ∼2.7\% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {\textgreater}20\% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

	abstract = {Horizontal integration of summary statistics from different GWAS traits can be used to evaluate evidence for their shared genetic causality. One popular method to do this is a Bayesian method, coloc, which is attractive in requiring only GWAS summary statistics and no linkage disequilibrium estimates and is now being used routinely to perform thousands of comparisons between traits. Here we show that while most users do not adjust default software values, misspecification of prior parameters can substantially alter posterior inference. We suggest data driven methods to derive sensible prior values, and demonstrate how sensitivity analysis can be used to assess robustness of posterior inference. The flexibility of coloc comes at the expense of an unrealistic assumption of a single causal variant per trait. This assumption can be relaxed by stepwise conditioning, but this requires external software and an LD matrix aligned to study alleles. We have now implemented conditioning within coloc, and propose a new alternative method, masking, that does not require LD and approximates conditioning when causal variants are independent. Importantly, masking can be used in combination with conditioning where allelically aligned LD estimates are available for only a single trait. We have implemented these developments in a new version of coloc which we hope will enable more informed choice of priors and overcome the restriction of the single causal variant assumptions in coloc analysis.},

The next challenge is to elucidate the causal genes and mechanisms involved. One approach is to use statistical colocalization to assess shared genetic aetiology across multiple related traits (e.g. molecular traits, metabolic pathways and complex diseases) to identify causal pathways, prioritize causal variants and evaluate pleiotropy. We propose HyPrColoc (Hypothesis Prioritisation for multi-trait Colocalization), an efficient deterministic Bayesian algorithm using GWAS summary statistics that can detect colocalization across vast numbers of traits simultaneously (e.g. 100 traits can be jointly analysed in around 1 s). We perform a genome-wide multi-trait colocalization analysis of coronary heart disease (CHD) and fourteen related traits, identifying 43 regions in which CHD colocalized with ≥1 trait, including 5 previously unknown CHD loci. Across the 43 loci, we further integrate gene and protein expression quantitative trait loci to identify candidate causal genes.},

Variants in the HMGCR gene region, which represent proxies for statin treatment, were associated with overall cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] per one standard deviation decrease in low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol 0.76, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–0.88, p=0.0003) but variants in gene regions representing alternative lipid-lowering treatment targets (PCSK9, LDLR, NPC1L1, APOC3, LPL) were not. Genetically predicted LDL-cholesterol was not associated with overall cancer risk (OR per standard deviation increase 1.01, 95\% CI 0.98–1.05, p=0.50). Our results predict that statins reduce cancer risk but other lipid-lowering treatments do not. This suggests that statins reduce cancer risk through a cholesterol independent pathway.},

	abstract = {Preclinical and epidemiological studies indicate a potential chemopreventive role of statins in epithelial ovarian cancer risk.To evaluate the association of genetically proxied inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (ie, genetic variants related to lower function of HMG-CoA reductase, target of statins) with epithelial ovarian cancer among the general population and in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis (N ≤196 475) were used to proxy therapeutic inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), respectively. Summary statistics were obtained for these SNPs from a GWAS meta-analysis of case-control analyses of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC; N = 63 347) and from a GWAS meta-analysis of retrospective cohort analyses of epithelial ovarian cancer among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA; N = 31 448). Across the 2 consortia, participants were enrolled between 1973 and 2014 and followed up through 2015. OCAC participants came from 14 countries and CIMBA participants came from 25 countries. SNPs were combined into multi-allelic models and mendelian randomization estimates representing lifelong inhibition of targets were generated using inverse-variance weighted random-effects models.Primary exposure was genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and secondary exposures were genetically proxied inhibition of NPC1L1 and PCSK9 and genetically proxied circulating LDL cholesterol levels.Overall and histotype-specific invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (general population) and epithelial ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2 mutation carriers), measured as ovarian cancer odds (general population) and hazard ratio (BRCA1/2 mutation carriers).The OCAC sample included 22 406 women with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer and 40 941 control individuals and the CIMBA sample included 3887 women with epithelial ovarian cancer and 27 561 control individuals. Median ages for the cohorts ranged from 41.5 to 59.0 years and all participants were of European ancestry. In the primary analysis, genetically proxied HMG-CoA reductase inhibition equivalent to a 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol was associated with lower odds of epithelial ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.60 [95\% CI, 0.43-0.83]; P = .002). In BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, genetically proxied HMG-CoA reductase inhibition was associated with lower ovarian cancer risk (hazard ratio, 0.69 [95\% CI, 0.51-0.93]; P = .01). In secondary analyses, there were no significant associations of genetically proxied inhibition of NPC1L1 (OR, 0.97 [95\% CI, 0.53-1.75]; P = .91), PCSK9 (OR, 0.98 [95\% CI, 0.85-1.13]; P = .80), or circulating LDL cholesterol (OR, 0.98 [95\% CI, 0.91-1.05]; P = .55) with epithelial ovarian cancer.Genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase was significantly associated with lower odds of epithelial ovarian cancer. However, these findings do not indicate risk reduction from medications that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase; further research is needed to understand whether there is a similar association with such medications.},

	abstract = {A conventional Mendelian randomization analysis assesses the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome by using genetic variants that are solely associated with the risk factor of interest as instrumental variables. However, in some cases, such as the case of triglyceride level as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it may be difficult to find a relevant genetic variant that is not also associated with related risk factors, such as other lipid fractions. Such a variant is known as pleiotropic. In this paper, we propose an extension of Mendelian randomization that uses multiple genetic variants associated with several measured risk factors to simultaneously estimate the causal effect of each of the risk factors on the outcome. This “multivariable Mendelian randomization” approach is similar to the simultaneous assessment of several treatments in a factorial randomized trial. In this paper, methods for estimating the causal effects are presented and compared using real and simulated data, and the assumptions necessary for a valid multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis are discussed. Subject to these assumptions, we demonstrate that triglyceride-related pathways have a causal effect on the risk of coronary heart disease independent of the effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.},

However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.},

	abstract = {Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–lowering alleles in or near NPC1L1 or HMGCR, encoding the respective molecular targets of ezetimibe and statins, have previously been used as proxies to study the efficacy of these lipid-lowering drugs. Alleles near HMGCR are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, similar to the increased incidence of new-onset diabetes associated with statin treatment in randomized clinical trials. It is unknown whether alleles near NPC1L1 are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes.To investigate whether LDL-C-lowering alleles in or near NPC1L1 and other genes encoding current or prospective molecular targets of lipid-lowering therapy (ie, HMGCR, PCSK9, ABCG5/G8, LDLR) are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes.The associations with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease of LDL-C-lowering genetic variants were investigated in meta-analyses of genetic association studies. Meta-analyses included 50 775 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 270 269 controls and 60 801 individuals with coronary artery disease and 123 504 controls. Data collection took place in Europe and the United States between 1991 and 2016.Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol–lowering alleles in or near NPC1L1, HMGCR, PCSK9, ABCG5/G8, and LDLR.Odds ratios (ORs) for type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol–lowering genetic variants at NPC1L1 were inversely associated with coronary artery disease (OR for a genetically predicted 1-mmol/L [38.7-mg/dL] reduction in LDL-C of 0.61 [95\% CI, 0.42-0.88]; P = .008) and directly associated with type 2 diabetes (OR for a genetically predicted 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C of 2.42 [95\% CI, 1.70-3.43]; P \&lt; .001). For PCSK9 genetic variants, the OR for type 2 diabetes per 1-mmol/L genetically predicted reduction in LDL-C was 1.19 (95\% CI, 1.02-1.38; P = .03). For a given reduction in LDL-C, genetic variants were associated with a similar reduction in coronary artery disease risk (I2 = 0\% for heterogeneity in genetic associations; P = .93). However, associations with type 2 diabetes were heterogeneous (I2 = 77.2\%; P = .002), indicating gene-specific associations with metabolic risk of LDL-C-lowering alleles.In this meta-analysis, exposure to LDL-C-lowering genetic variants in or near NPC1L1 and other genes was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. These data provide insights into potential adverse effects of LDL-C-lowering therapy.},

Here we characterize the genetic architecture of the human plasma proteome in healthy blood donors from the INTERVAL study. We identify 1,927 genetic associations with 1,478 proteins, a fourfold increase on existing knowledge, including trans associations for 1,104 proteins. To understand the consequences of perturbations in plasma protein levels, we apply an integrated approach that links genetic variation with biological pathway, disease, and drug databases. We show that protein quantitative trait loci overlap with gene expression quantitative trait loci, as well as with disease-associated loci, and find evidence that protein biomarkers have causal roles in disease using Mendelian randomization analysis. By linking genetic factors to diseases via specific proteins, our analyses highlight potential therapeutic targets, opportunities for matching existing drugs with new disease indications, and potential safety concerns for drugs under development.},

	abstract = {Background Mendelian randomization is used to test and estimate the magnitude of a causal effect of a phenotype on an outcome by using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs). Estimates of association from IV analysis are biased in the direction of the confounded, observational association between phenotype and outcome. The magnitude of the bias depends on the F-statistic for the strength of relationship between IVs and phenotype. We seek to develop guidelines for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies to minimize bias.Methods IV analysis was performed on simulated and real data to investigate the effect on bias of size of study, number and choice of instruments and method of analysis.Results Bias is shown to increase as the expected F-statistic decreases, and can be reduced by using parsimonious models of genetic association (i.e. not over-parameterized) and by adjusting for measured covariates. Using data from a single study, the causal estimate of a unit increase in log-transformed C-reactive protein on fibrinogen (μmol/l) is shown to increase from −0.005 (P = 0.99) to 0.792 (P = 0.00003) due to injudicious choice of instrument. Moreover, when the observed F-statistic is larger than expected in a particular study, the causal estimate is more biased towards the observational association and its standard error is smaller. This correlation between causal estimate and standard error introduces a second source of bias into meta-analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Bias can be alleviated in meta-analyses by using individual level data and by pooling genetic effects across studies.Conclusions Weak instrument bias is of practical importance for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Post hoc choice of instruments, genetic models or data based on measured F-statistics can exacerbate bias. In particular, the commonly cited rule of thumb that F \&gt; 10 avoids bias in IV analysis is misleading.},

Components of the metabolic syndrome, including visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, with or without clinically manifest diabetes mellitus, low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hypertension have all been related to increased breast cancer risk. The biochemical mechanisms include extraglandular oestrogen production, reduced sex hormone-binding globulin with consequent elevation of the bioactive plasma free oestradiol and increased insulin biosynthesis, all of which exert mitogenic effects on both untransformed and neoplastic breast epithelial cells. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome also have in common an increased production of leptin and a decreased production of adiponectin by adipose tissue, with consequent elevations and reductions, respectively, in the circulating levels of these two adipokines. These changes in plasma leptin and adiponectin, acting through endocrine and paracrine mechanisms, have been associated in several studies with an increase in breast cancer risk and, perhaps, to more aggressive tumours; studies in vitro showed that leptin stimulates, and adiponectin inhibits, tumour cell proliferation and the microvessel angiogenesis which is essential for breast cancer development and progression.},

	abstract = {Statins function in the mevalonate pathway as small-molecule inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which lowers cholesterol. These agents are effective in preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD), largely because of this effect.Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that analysed the effects of statins and other lipid-lowering agents (for example, fibrates, nicotinic acid and cholestyramine) to prevent CVD included safety monitoring to address whether statins increased cancer incidence and cancer mortality. Ironically, these results were the first to suggest that statins can prevent cancer.In addition to the HMG-CoA-dependent effects, statins have important cholesterol/HMG-CoA-independent effects, such as effects on lymphocyte-function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1), that are thought to contribute to potential cancer prevention.Important work in preclinical models of colorectal and breast cancer, and melanoma, indicates that statin anticancer effects involve the inhibition of geranylgeranylation, primarily of Rho proteins.Secondary results of the CVD RCTs, as well as observational and preclinical studies, indicate that statins have a strong potential for preventing colorectal cancer and melanoma.The beneficial effects of statins on inhibiting carcinogenesis could involve their effects on important disease pathways including inflammation, immunomodulation and angiogenesis.Statins are broad-spectrum agents. Current research is revealing important new statin targets (such as LFA1, Rho isoforms, and post-prenylation enzymes) leading to the development of more-specifically targeted agents for cancer prevention.},

The effects of cholesterol on tumor pathology required its conversion to 27HC by the cytochrome P450 oxidase CYP27A1 and were attenuated by treatment with CYP27A1 inhibitors. In human breast cancer specimens, CYP27A1 expression levels correlated with tumor grade. In high-grade tumors, both tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages exhibited high expression levels of the enzyme.

	abstract = {The Liver X Receptors (LXRs) are oxysterol-activated transcription factors that upregulate a suite of genes that together promote coordinated mobilization of excess cholesterol from cells and from the body. The LXRs, like other nuclear receptors, are anti-inflammatory, inhibiting signal-dependent induction of pro-inflammatory genes by nuclear factor-κB, activating protein-1, and other transcription factors. Synthetic LXR agonists have been shown to ameliorate atherosclerosis and a wide range of inflammatory disorders in preclinical animal models. Although this has suggested potential for application to human disease, systemic LXR activation is complicated by hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia, consequences of lipogenic gene induction in the liver by LXRα. The past several years have seen the development of multiple advanced LXR therapeutics aiming to avoid hepatic lipogenesis, including LXRβ-selective agonists, tissue-selective agonists, and transrepression-selective agonists. Although several synthetic LXR agonists have made it to phase I clinical trials, none have progressed due to unforeseen adverse reactions or undisclosed reasons. Nonetheless, several sophisticated pharmacologic strategies, including structure-guided drug design, cell-specific drug targeting, as well as non-systemic drug routes have been initiated and remain to be comprehensively explored. In addition, recent studies have identified potential utility for targeting the LXRs during therapy with other agents, such as glucocorticoids and rexinoids. Despite the pitfalls encountered to date in translation of LXR agonists to human disease, it appears likely that this accelerating field will ultimately yield effective and safe applications for LXR targeting in humans.},

This study examined the association between CYP27A1 expression and prognosis in a cohort of 193 premenopausal patients with lymph node-negative primary BC with limited exposure to adjuvant systemic cancer treatments. In multivariable analyses among patients with ER+ tumors, high CYP27A1 protein and mRNA expressions were associated with four- and eight-fold reductions in the incidence of distant recurrence-free survival events: HRadj = 0.26, 95\% CI = 0.07–0.93 and HRadj = 0.13, 95\% CI = 0.03–0.60, respectively. In vitro studies revealed that 27HC treatment potently inhibited ER+ BC cell proliferation under lipid-depleted conditions regardless of estradiol levels, transcriptionally mediated through the downregulation of ER signaling with a concomitant upregulation of cholesterol export. Importantly, if validated, these results may have implications for adjuvant treatment decisions in premenopausal patients, especially when de-escalation of therapy is being considered.},

	abstract = {The impact of systemic 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) and intratumoral CYP27A1 expression on pathobiology and clinical response to statins in breast cancer needs clarification. 27HC is an oxysterol produced from cholesterol by the monooxygenase CYP27A1, which regulates intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. 27HC also acts as an endogenous selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator capable of increasing breast cancer growth and metastasis. 27HC levels can be modulated by statins or direct inhibition of CYP27A1, thereby attenuating its pro-tumorigenic activities. Herein, the effect of statins on serum 27HC and tumor-specific CYP27A1 expression was evaluated in 42 breast cancer patients treated with atorvastatin within a phase II clinical trial. Further, the associations between CYP27A1 expression with other primary tumor pathological features and clinical outcomes were studied in two additional independent cohorts. Statin treatment effectively decreased serum 27HC and deregulated CYP27A1 expression in tumors. However, these changes were not associated with anti-proliferative responses to statin treatment. CYP27A1 was heterogeneously expressed among primary tumors, with high expression significantly associated with high tumor grade, ER negativity and basal-like subtype. High CYP27A1 expression was independently prognostic for longer recurrence-free and overall survival. Importantly, the beneficial effect of high CYP27A1 in ER-positive breast cancer seemed limited to women aged ≤50 years. These results establish a link between CYP27A1 and breast cancer pathobiology and prognosis and propose that the efficacy of statins in reducing serum lipids does not directly translate to anti-proliferative effects in tumors. Changes in other undetermined serum or tumor factors suggestively mediate the anti-proliferative effects of statins in breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which includes cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx, is a cause of substantial global morbidity and mortality. Strategies to reduce disease burden include discovery of novel therapies and repurposing of existing drugs. Statins are commonly prescribed for lowering circulating cholesterol by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Results from some observational studies suggest that statin use may reduce HNSCC risk. We appraised the relationship of genetically-proxied cholesterol-lowering drug targets and other circulating lipid traits with oral (OC) and oropharyngeal (OPC) cancer risk using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). For the primary analysis, germline genetic variants in HMGCR, NPC1L1, CETP, PCSK9 and LDLR were used to proxy the effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies. In secondary analyses, variants were used to proxy circulating levels of other lipid traits in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 188,578 individuals. Both primary and secondary analyses aimed to estimate the downstream causal effect of cholesterol lowering therapies on OC and OPC risk. The second sample for MR was taken from a GWAS of 6,034 OC and OPC cases and 6,585 controls (GAME-ON). Analyses were replicated in UK Biobank, using 839 OC and OPC cases and 372,016 controls and the results of the GAME-ON and UK Biobank analyses combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis. We found limited evidence of a causal effect of genetically-proxied LDL-C lowering using HMGCR, NPC1L1, CETP or other circulating lipid traits on either OC or OPC risk. Genetically-proxied PCSK9 inhibition equivalent to a 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was associated with an increased risk of OC and OPC combined (OR 1.8 95\%CI 1.2, 2.8, p = 9.31 x10-05), with good concordance between GAME-ON and UK Biobank (I2 = 22\%). Effects for PCSK9 appeared stronger in relation to OPC (OR 2.6 95\%CI 1.4, 4.9) than OC (OR 1.4 95\%CI 0.8, 2.4). LDLR variants, resulting in genetically-proxied reduction in LDL-C equivalent to a 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL), reduced the risk of OC and OPC combined (OR 0.7, 95\%CI 0.5, 1.0, p = 0.006). A series of pleiotropy-robust and outlier detection methods showed that pleiotropy did not bias our findings. We found limited evidence for a role of cholesterol-lowering in OC and OPC risk, suggesting previous observational results may have been confounded. There was some evidence that genetically-proxied inhibition of PCSK9 increased risk, while lipid-lowering variants in LDLR, reduced risk of combined OC and OPC. This result suggests that the mechanisms of action of PCSK9 on OC and OPC risk may be independent of its cholesterol lowering effects; however, this was not supported uniformly across all sensitivity analyses and further replication of this finding is required.},

Mediation analysis is the method of decomposing the effects of an exposure on an outcome, which act directly, and those that act via mediating variables. These effects are decomposed through the use of multivariable analysis to estimate the causal effects between three types of variables: exposures, mediators, and an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) is a recent extension to MR that uses genetic variants associated with multiple, potentially related exposures to estimate the effect of each exposure on a single outcome. MVMR allows for equivalent analysis to mediation within the MR framework and therefore can also be used to estimate mediation effects. This approach retains the benefits of using genetic instruments for causal inference, such as avoiding bias due to confounding, while allowing for estimation of the different effects required for mediation analysis. This review explains MVMR, what is estimated when one exposure is a mediator of another in an MVMR estimation, and how MR and MVMR can therefore be used to estimate mediated effects. This review then goes on to consider the advantages and limitations of using MR and MVMR to conduct mediation analysis.},

Experiments in mice lacking the enzyme which synthesizes 27OHC, CYP27A1, or the enzyme which catabolizes 27OHC, CYP7B1, have demonstrated that 27OHC adversely affects estrogen-related cardiovascular protection and bone mineralization.

Given the high prevalence of breast cancer, new life-style or chemotherapeutic approaches are required. In this regard, cholesterol has emerged as a risk factor for the onset of breast cancer, and elevated cholesterol is associated with a poor prognosis. While treatment with cholesterol lowering medication is not associated with breast cancer risk, it does appear to be protective against recurrence. Importantly, the cholesterol axis represents a potential target for both life-style and pharmacological intervention. This review will outline the clinical and preclinical data supporting a role for cholesterol in breast cancer pathophysiology. Specific focus is given to 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC; (3β,25R)-Cholest-5-ene-3,26-diol)), a primary metabolite of cholesterol that has recently been defined as an endogenous Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator.

Here, we show that cholesterol mediates the metastatic effects of a high-fat diet via its oxysterol metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol. Ablation or inhibition of CYP27A1, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in 27-hydroxycholesterol biosynthesis, significantly reduces metastasis in relevant animal models of cancer. The robust effects of 27-hydroxycholesterol on metastasis requires myeloid immune cell function, and it was found that this oxysterol increases the number of polymorphonuclear-neutrophils and γδ-T cells at distal metastatic sites. The pro-metastatic actions of 27-hydroxycholesterol requires both polymorphonuclear-neutrophils and γδ-T cells, and 27-hydroxycholesterol treatment results in a decreased number of cytotoxic CD8+T lymphocytes. Therefore, through its actions on γδ-T cells and polymorphonuclear-neutrophils, 27-hydroxycholesterol functions as a biochemical mediator of the metastatic effects of hypercholesterolemia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of epidemiological and genetic studies have attempted to determine whether levels of circulating lipids are associated with risks of various cancers, including breast cancer (BC). However, it remains unclear whether a causal relationship exists between lipids and BC. If alteration of lipid levels also reduced risk of BC, this could present a target for disease prevention. This study aimed to assess a potential causal relationship between genetic variants associated with plasma lipid traits (high-density lipoprotein, HDL; low-density lipoprotein, LDL; triglycerides, TGs) with risk for BC using Mendelian randomization (MR).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data from genome-wide association studies in up to 215,551 participants from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) were used to construct genetic instruments for plasma lipid traits. The effect of these instruments on BC risk was evaluated using genetic data from the BCAC (Breast Cancer Association Consortium) based on 122,977 BC cases and 105,974 controls. Using MR, we observed that a 1-standard-deviation genetically determined increase in HDL levels is associated with an increased risk for all BCs (HDL: OR [odds ratio] = 1.08, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.13, P {\textless} 0.001). Multivariable MR analysis, which adjusted for the effects of LDL, TGs, body mass index (BMI), and age at menarche, corroborated this observation for HDL (OR = 1.06, 95\% CI = 1.03-1.10, P = 4.9 × 10-4) and also found a relationship between LDL and BC risk (OR = 1.03, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.07, P = 0.02). We did not observe a difference in these relationships when stratified by breast tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status. We repeated this analysis using genetic variants independent of the leading association at core HDL pathway genes and found that these variants were also associated with risk for BCs (OR = 1.11, 95\% CI = 1.06-1.16, P = 1.5 × 10-6), including locus-specific associations at ABCA1 (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily A Member 1), APOE-APOC1-APOC4-APOC2 (Apolipoproteins E, C1, C4, and C2), and CETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein). In addition, we found evidence that genetic variation at the ABO locus is associated with both lipid levels and BC. Through multiple statistical approaches, we minimized and tested for the confounding effects of pleiotropy and population stratification on our analysis; however, the possible existence of residual pleiotropy and stratification remains a limitation of this study.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that genetically elevated plasma HDL and LDL levels appear to be associated with increased BC risk. Future studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying this putative causal relationship, with the goal of developing potential therapeutic strategies aimed at altering the cholesterol-mediated effect on BC risk.},

In response to nutritional stimuli, dynamic interactions amongst these cell populations can be modulated, consequently leading to an alteration of the glandular function, physiology, and ultimately disease pathogenesis. For example, obesity, a chronic over-nutritional condition, is known to disrupt homeostasis within the mammary gland and increase risk of breast cancer development. In contrast, emerging evidence has demonstrated that fasting or caloric restriction can negatively impact mammary tumorigenesis. However, how fasting induces phenotypic and functional population differences in the mammary microenvironment is not well understood.

Data are lacking on specific lifestyle modifications to prevent or treat these conditions to improve women's chances of survival from breast cancer. The Nurses' Health Study cohorts provide new evidence that diets with the potential to elevate circulating insulin or glucose are associated with breast cancer prognosis. The researchers found statistically significant evidence that women in the highest quintile of glycemic load had a 31\% higher risk of breast cancer–specific mortality and a 26\% higher risk of all-cause mortality. While a randomized controlled clinical trial testing if a reduced glycemic load diet reduces recurrence or death would be optimal, evidence from this observational study suggests that diet matters in survival from breast cancer.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The investigation of dose-response associations between carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, glycemic load, and risk of breast cancer stratified by menopausal status, hormone receptor status, and body mass index (BMI) remains inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analyses was conducted to investigate these associations.
DATA SOURCES: As part of the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Continuous Update Project, PubMed was searched up to May 2015 for relevant studies on these associations.
STUDY SELECTION: Prospective studies reporting associations between carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, or glycemic load and breast cancer risk were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently extracted data from included studies.
RESULTS: Random-effects models were used to summarize relative risks (RRs) and 95\%CIs. Heterogeneity between subgroups, including menopausal status, hormone receptor status, and BMI was explored using meta-regression. Nineteen publications were included. The summary RRs (95\%CIs) for breast cancer were 1.04 (1.00-1.07) per 10 units/d for glycemic index, 1.01 (0.98-1.04) per 50 units/d for glycemic load, and 1.00 (0.96-1.05) per 50 g/d for carbohydrate intake. For glycemic index, the association appeared slightly stronger among postmenopausal women (summary RR per 10 units/d, 1.06; 95\%CI, 1.02-1.10) than among premenopausal women, though the difference was not statistically significant (Pheterogeneity = 0.15). Glycemic load and carbohydrate intake were positively associated with breast cancer among postmenopausal women with estrogen-negative tumors (summary RR for glycemic load, 1.28; 95\%CI, 1.08-1.52; and summary RR for carbohydrates, 1.13; 95\%CI, 1.02-1.25). No differences in BMI were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Menopausal and hormone receptor status, but not BMI, might be potential influencing factors for the associations between carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, glycemic load, and breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Diets high in glycaemic index (GI) or glycaemic load (GL) have been hypothesised to increase the risks of certain cancers by increasing blood glucose or insulin concentrations. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to evaluate the association between GI or GL and diabetes-related cancers (DRC), including bladder, breast, colon–rectum, endometrium, liver and pancreas, which are associated with an increased risk for diabetes, and prostate cancer, which is associated with a reduced risk for diabetes. We searched Pubmed, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases up to September 2011 and reference lists of relevant articles. Relative risks (RR) and 95 \% CI for the highest v. the lowest categories were extracted and pooled using a random-effects model. Thirty-six prospective cohort studies with a total of 60 811 DRC cases were included in the present meta-analysis. In a comparison of the highest and lowest categories, the pooled RR of DRC were 1·07 (95 \% CI 1·04, 1·11; n 30) for GI and 1·02 (95 \% CI 0·96, 1·08; n 33) for GL. In an analysis of site-specific cancer risks, we found significant associations for GI in relation to breast cancer (RR 1·06; 95 \% CI 1·02, 1·11; n 11) and colorectal cancer (RR 1·08; 95 \% CI 1·00, 1·17; n 9 studies). GL was significantly associated with the risk of endometrial cancer (RR 1·21; 95 \% CI 1·07, 1·37; n 5). In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest a modest-to-weak association between a diet that induces a high glucose response and DRC risks.},

Case-control and cohort studies published before October 2007 that reported cancer risk estimates for GI and GL were included. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were estimated for breast, colorectal, endometrial, and pancreatic cancer.Results: Thirty-nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The interquantile ranges of GL were significantly wider in case-control studies, most of which were conducted in European countries, than in cohort studies. Cohort studies that presented lower ranges of GL also reported lower risk estimates. Overall, both GL and GI were significantly associated with a greater risk of colorectal (summary RR = 1.26; 95\% CI: 1.11, 1.44 and RR = 1.18; 95\% CI: 1.05, 1.34, respectively) and endometrial (RR = 1.36; 95\% CI: 1.14, 1.62 and RR = 1.22; 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.49) cancer than of breast and pancreatic cancer. There was, however, a significant between-study heterogeneity for colorectal cancer (P \&lt; 0.0001). The association between GL and breast cancer disappeared when publication bias was taken into account. No association was found for pancreatic cancer.Conclusion: This comprehensive meta-analysis of GI and GL and cancer risk suggested an overall direct association with colorectal and endometrial cancer.},

Our objectives were to compare cancer incidence in twins with national rates and to estimate both the probability that co-twins of affected twins may develop cancer and the importance of genetic predisposition and environment in cancer development. The nationwide record linkage of the Finnish Twin Cohort Study, the Finnish Cancer Registry and the Central Population Register allowed the follow-up of 12,941 same-sexed twin pairs for incident primary cancers from 1976 to 1995. Zygosity was determined by use of a validated questionnaire in 1975. Methods included calculation of standardized incidence ratios and concordances and fitting of structural equation models. A total of 1,613 malignant neoplasms occurred in the cohort. The overall cancer incidence among twins resembled that among the general population. Monozygotic co-twins of affected twins were at 50\% higher risk than were dizygotic co-twins. Based on genetic modeling, inherited genetic factors accounted for 18\% (95\% confidence interval 4–32\%) of the liability in inter-individual variation in the risk of overall cancer, while non-genetic factors shared by twins accounted for 7\% (0–16\%) and unique environmental factors for 75\% (65–85\%). Our results appear to exclude a contribution greater than one-third for genetic predisposition in the development of cancer in the general population, thus pointing to the earlier confirmed substantial role of environment.

	abstract = {There have been recent proposals advocating the use of additive gene-environment interaction instead of the widely used multiplicative scale, as a more relevant public health measure. Using gene-environment independence enhances statistical power for testing multiplicative interaction in case-control studies. However, under departure from this assumption, substantial bias in the estimates and inflated type I error in the corresponding tests can occur. In this paper, we extend the empirical Bayes (EB) approach previously developed for multiplicative interaction, which trades off between bias and efficiency in a data-adaptive way, to the additive scale. An EB estimator of the relative excess risk due to interaction is derived, and the corresponding Wald test is proposed with a general regression setting under a retrospective likelihood framework. We study the impact of gene-environment association on the resultant test with case-control data. Our simulation studies suggest that the EB approach uses the gene-environment independence assumption in a data-adaptive way and provides a gain in power compared with the standard logistic regression analysis and better control of type I error when compared with the analysis assuming gene-environment independence. We illustrate the methods with data from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium.},

Awareness of haematuria as the major presenting symptom is paramount, and early diagnosis with individualised treatment and follow-up is the key to a successful outcome. For non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the mainstay of treatment is complete resection of the tumour followed by induction and maintenance immunotherapy with intravesical BCG vaccine or intravesical chemotherapy. For muscle-invasive bladder cancer, multimodal treatment involving radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy offers the best chance for cure. Selected patients with muscle-invasive tumours can be offered bladder-sparing trimodality treatment consisting of transurethral resection with chemoradiation. Advanced disease is best treated with systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy; immunotherapy is emerging as a viable salvage treatment for patients in whom first-line chemotherapy cannot control the disease. Developments in the past 2 years have shed light on genetic subtypes of bladder cancer that might differ from one another in response to various treatments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer mortality rates have been elevated in northern New England for at least five decades. Incidence rates in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont are about 20\% higher than the United States overall. We explored reasons for this excess, focusing on arsenic in drinking water from private wells, which are particularly prevalent in the region.
METHODS: In a population-based case-control study in these three states, 1213 bladder cancer case patients and 1418 control subjects provided information on suspected risk factors. Log transformed arsenic concentrations were estimated by linear regression based on measurements in water samples from current and past homes. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: Bladder cancer risk increased with increasing water intake (Ptrend = .003). This trend was statistically significant among participants with a history of private well use (Ptrend = .01). Among private well users, this trend was apparent if well water was derived exclusively from shallow dug wells (which are vulnerable to contamination from manmade sources, Ptrend = .002) but not if well water was supplied only by deeper drilled wells (Ptrend = .48). If dug wells were used pre-1960, when arsenical pesticides were widely used in the region, heavier water consumers ({\textgreater}2.2 L/day) had double the risk of light users ({\textless}1.1 L/day, Ptrend = .01). Among all participants, cumulative arsenic exposure from all water sources, lagged 40 years, yielded a positive risk gradient (Ptrend = .004); among the highest-exposed participants (97.5th percentile), risk was twice that of the lowest-exposure quartile (odds ratio = 2.24, 95\% confidence interval = 1.29 to 3.89).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an association between low-to-moderate levels of arsenic in drinking water and bladder cancer risk in New England. In addition, historical consumption of water from private wells, particularly dug wells in an era when arsenical pesticides were widely used, was associated with increased bladder cancer risk and may have contributed to the New England excess.},

	abstract = {Methods have been developed for Mendelian randomization that can obtain consistent causal estimates while relaxing the instrumental variable assumptions. These include multivariable Mendelian randomization, in which a genetic variant may be associated with multiple risk factors so long as any association with the outcome is via the measured risk factors (measured pleiotropy), and the MR-Egger (Mendelian randomization-Egger) method, in which a genetic variant may be directly associated with the outcome not via the risk factor of interest, so long as the direct effects of the variants on the outcome are uncorrelated with their associations with the risk factor (unmeasured pleiotropy). In this paper, we extend the MR-Egger method to a multivariable setting to correct for both measured and unmeasured pleiotropy. We show, through theoretical arguments and a simulation study, that the multivariable MR-Egger method has advantages over its univariable counterpart in terms of plausibility of the assumption needed for consistent causal estimation and power to detect a causal effect when this assumption is satisfied. The methods are compared in an applied analysis to investigate the causal effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary heart disease risk. The multivariable MR-Egger method will be useful to analyse high-dimensional data in situations where the risk factors are highly related and it is difficult to find genetic variants specifically associated with the risk factor of interest (multivariable by design), and as a sensitivity analysis when the genetic variants are known to have pleiotropic effects on measured risk factors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful tool in epidemiology that can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of unobserved confounding, by utilizing genetic variants that are instrumental variables (IVs) for the exposure. This has been extended to multivariable MR (MVMR) to estimate the effect of two or more exposures on an outcome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We use simulations and theory to clarify the interpretation of estimated effects in a MVMR analysis under a range of underlying scenarios, where a secondary exposure acts variously as a confounder, a mediator, a pleiotropic pathway and a collider. We then describe how instrument strength and validity can be assessed for an MVMR analysis in the single-sample setting, and develop tests to assess these assumptions in the popular two-sample summary data setting. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on body mass index.
CONCLUSION: MVMR analysis consistently estimates the direct causal effect of an exposure, or exposures, of interest and provides a powerful tool for determining causal effects in a wide range of scenarios with either individual- or summary-level data.},

They then extended the methods to handle nonlinear exposure-response relations. In the present article, methods are illustrated using studies of the relation between alcohol consumption and colorectal and lung cancer risks from the ongoing Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer. In these examples, the differences between the results of a meta-analysis of summarized published data and the pooled analysis of the individual original data were small. However, incorrectly assuming no correlation between relative risk estimates for exposure categories from the same study gave biased confidence intervals for the trend and biased P values for the tests for nonlinearity and between-study heterogeneity when there was strong confounding by other model covariates. The authors illustrate the use of 2 publicly available user-friendly programs (Stata and SAS) to implement meta-analysis for dose-response data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ezetimibe is a widely used medication to reduce the plasma cholesterol level, particularly low-density lipoprotein level. However, its impact on cancer remains controversial. Here, its impacts on risks of various types of cancers were meta-analyzed.
METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched and randomized controlled trials with followed up for at least 24 weeks were selected and included. The experimental group was defined as those patients treated with ezetimibe alone or with other medications, and the control group was defined as those who received a placebo or the matched medication. The number of new cancer cases or cancer-related deaths was extracted. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (version 5.3).
RESULTS: Nine trials enrolling 35 222 patients were included in the analyses. Compared with the control group, ezetimibe increased the number of new intestine cancer patients [relative risk (RR), 1.30; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.67; P  = 0.03] and had a trend to increase the number of new breast cancer patients (RR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.98; P  = 0.07). There was no significant difference in new hepatobiliary cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer or cancer of other sites. Ezetimibe did not significantly increase the risk of new cancer in total (RR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.11; P  = 0.38), cancer-related death (RR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.26; P  = 0.10) or cancer events (RR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.12; P  = 0.30). In terms of lipid-lowering effect, ezetimibe significantly reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
CONCLUSION: Ezetimibe may increase the risk of intestine cancer and has a trend of increasing the risk of breast cancer. There is no evidence to support that it increases or decreases the risk of other types.},

	abstract = {Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.},

We conduct an extended genome-wide association study of genetic influences on 123 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics from up to 24,925 individuals and identify eight novel loci for amino acids, pyruvate and fatty acids. The LPA locus link with cardiovascular risk exemplifies how detailed metabolic profiling may inform underlying aetiology via extensive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism. Genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization uncover wide-spread causal effects of lipoprotein(a) on overall lipoprotein metabolism and we assess potential pleiotropic consequences of genetically elevated lipoprotein(a) on diverse morbidities via electronic health-care records.

	abstract = {Oxysterols (OHC) are biologically active cholesterol metabolites circulating in plasma that may be formed enzymatically (e.g. 24S-OHC, 25-OHC and 27-OHC) or by autoxidative mechanisms (e.g. 7-ketocholesterol, 7β-OHC and 25-OHC). Oxysterols are more soluble than cholesterol and are reported to exert inflammatory, cytoprotective and apoptotic effects according to concentration and species. Esterified oxysterols have been analysed in people with dementia and cardiovascular diseases although there is no consistent relationship between oxysterol esters and disease. However, oxysterol esters are held in lipoprotein core and may not relate to the concentration and activity of plasma free oxysterols. Methodological limitations have challenged the analysis of free oxysterols to date., We have developed a fast, sensitive and specific quantitative LC-MS/MS, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method to target five oxysterols in human plasma with analyte recoveries between 72\% and 82\% and sensitivities between 5 and 135 pg/ml. A novel method was used to investigate the hypothesis that simvastatin may reduce the concentrations of specific plasma free oxysterols in hypercholesterolaemia., Twenty healthy male volunteers were recruited (aged 41–63 years); ten were asymptomatic with high plasma cholesterol {\textgreater} 6.5 mM and ten were healthy with normal plasma cholesterol ({\textless} 6.5 mM). Simvastatin (40 mg/day) was prescribed to those with hypercholesterolaemia. Plasma samples were taken from both groups at baseline and after three months. Simvastatin reduced plasma cholesterol by {\textasciitilde}35\% (p {\textless} 0.05) at the end of three months., Oxysterols generated by autoxidation (but not enzymatically) were elevated up to 45 fold in hypercholesterolaemic midlife men. Plasma oxysterols were restored to those of healthy controls after simvastatin intervention suggesting that autoxidation is either prevented by simvastatin directly or that autoxidation is less prevalent when plasma cholesterol concentrations are within the normal range.},

	abstract = {Objective— Cholesterol efflux from macrophages in the artery wall, a key cardioprotective mechanism, is largely coordinated by the nuclear oxysterol-activated liver X receptor, LXRα. We investigated the effect of statins on LXR target gene expression and cholesterol efflux from human macrophages.

Methods and Results— In human macrophages (THP-1 cell line and primary cells), the archetypal statin, compactin, greatly reduced mRNA levels of 2 LXR target genes, ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA, as well as decreased cholesterol efflux. Commonly prescribed statins also downregulated LXR target gene expression in THP-1 cells. We provide several lines of evidence indicating that statins decrease expression of LXR target genes by inhibiting the synthesis of an oxysterol ligand for LXR, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. When THP-1 cells were cholesterol-loaded via incubation with acetylated low-density lipoprotein, synthesis of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol was greatly reduced and the downregulatory effect of compactin on ABCA1 mRNA levels and cholesterol efflux was lost.

Conclusions— Our results suggest that statins may downregulate cholesterol efflux from nonloaded human macrophages by inhibiting synthesis of an oxysterol ligand for LXR. Further work is needed to determine how relevant our observations are to arterial foam cells in vivo.},

Presently several pharmaceutical companies are working to develop such compounds, which will require finding a path for separating these beneficial effects from the detrimental stimulation of triglyceride synthesis also inherent to LXR agonists. Other challenges to the drug development process include species differences, which makes prediction of in vivo effects of LXR agonists in humans difficult.

	abstract = {BACKGOUND: Circulating oxysterols, cholesterol metabolites with important signaling functions, are increasingly being recognized as candidate biomarkers for several diseases, but associations with demographic and health characteristics remain poorly described.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize associations of major circulating oxysterols with sex, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), lifestyle factors, and use of common medications.
METHODS: We measured plasma concentrations of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC), 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-OHC), 7ɑ-hydroxycholesterol (7ɑ-OHC), and 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4β-OHC) from 1,440 participants of a completed clinical trial for the chemoprevention of colorectal adenomas. Adjusted percent difference in means were calculated using linear regression.
RESULTS: Women had 18\% (95\% CI, 14\%, 22\%) lower 27-OHC and 21\% (15\%, 27\%) higher 4β-OHC than men. Blacks had 15\% (7\%, 23\%) higher 4β-OHC than Non-Hispanic Whites, and Asian or Pacific Islanders had 19\% (2\%, 35\%) higher 7ɑ-OHC than Non-Hispanic Whites. Individuals of BMI ≥35 kg/m2 had 33\% (25\%, 41\%) lower 4β-OHC than those {\textless}25 kg/m2. Current smokers had 15\% (5\%, 24\%) higher 7ɑ-OHC than never smokers, and daily alcohol drinkers had 17\% (10\%, 24\%) higher 7ɑ-OHC than never drinkers. Statin use was associated with lower concentrations of all 5 oxysterols. Differences in mean {\textless}15\% were found for characteristics such as age, total dietary energy intake, physical activity, diabetes, and anti-inflammatory drug use.
CONCLUSION: Circulating oxysterols are uniquely associated with multiple demographic and health characteristics.},

In addition, several synthetic LXR agonists such as T0901317 and GW3965 were synthesized. Oxysterols are formed in amounts proportional to cholesterol content in the cell and therefore LXR operate as cholesterol sensors which protect from cholesterol overload by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption, stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoproteins (HDL), its transport to the liver, conversion to bile acids, and biliary excretion. In addition, LXR agonists activate fatty acid synthesis by stimulating the expression of a lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), leading to the elevation of plasma triglycerides and liver steatosis. Lipogenic effect seems is the most important negative feature of LXR agonists considered as potential hypolipidemic drugs. Some of currently used drugs also affect LXR signaling. For example, statins may impair LXR signaling by inhibiting oxysterol synthesis, whereas fibrates and thiazolidinediones increase LXR expression and activity.},

BAs are synthesized in the liver by multi-step reactions catalyzed via two distinct routes, the classical pathway (producing the 12α-hydroxylated primary BA, cholic acid), and the alternative pathway (producing the non-12α-hydroxylated primary BA, chenodeoxycholic acid). BA synthesis and excretion is a major pathway of cholesterol and lipid catabolism, and thus, is implicated in a variety of metabolic diseases including obesity, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, both oxysterols and BAs function as signaling molecules that activate multiple nuclear and membrane receptor-mediated signaling pathways in various tissues, regulating glucose, lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and energy expenditure. Modulating BA synthesis and composition to regulate BA signaling is an interesting and novel direction for developing therapies for metabolic disease. In this review, we summarize the most recent findings on the role of BA synthetic pathways, with a focus on the role of the alternative pathway, which has been under-investigated, in treating hyperglycemia and fatty liver disease. We also discuss future perspectives to develop promising pharmacological strategies targeting the alternative BA synthetic pathway for the treatment of metabolic diseases.},

	abstract = {The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are important in regulating lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses in macrophages. Activation of PPARγ represses key inflammatory response gene expressions. Recently, we identified a new cholesterol metabolite, 25-hydroxycholesterol-3-sulfate (25HC3S), as a potent regulatory molecule of lipid metabolism. In this paper, we report the effect of 25HC3S and its precursor 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) on PPARγ activity and on inflammatory responses. Addition of 25HC3S to human macrophages markedly increased nuclear PPARγ and cytosol IκB and decreased nuclear NF-κB protein levels. PPARγ response element reporter gene assays showed that 25HC3S significantly increased luciferase activities. PPARγ competitor assay showed that the Ki for 25HC3S was ∼1 μM, similar to those of other known natural ligands. NF-κB-dependent promoter reporter gene assays showed that 25HC3S suppressed TNFα-induced luciferase activities only when cotransfected with pcDNAI-PPARγ plasmid. In addition, 25HC3S decreased LPS-induced expression and release of IL-1β. In the PPARγ-specific siRNA transfected macrophages or in the presence of PPARγ-specific antagonist, 25HC3S failed to increase IκB and to suppress TNFα and IL-1β expression. In contrast to 25HC3S, its precursor 25HC, a known liver X receptor ligand, decreased nuclear PPARγ and cytosol IκB and increased nuclear NF-κB protein levels. We conclude that 25HC3S acts in macrophages as a PPARγ ligand and suppresses inflammatory responses via the PPARγ/IκB/NF-κB signaling pathway.},

Oxidative modifications of these molecules can occur and result in the production of oxysterols and oxidized fatty acids. Significantly, these modified molecules not only participate in basic metabolic processes but they are also involved in signaling pathways. These two groups of molecules are known to regulate the activity of a special group of ligand-activated transcription factors, known as nuclear receptors. Oxysterols activate liver X receptor (LXR), while oxidized fatty acids regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). These nuclear hormone receptors control the expression of their target genes upon ligand binding and via this effect many physiological as well as pathological processes.

Both the receptors themselves and their activators have been shown to exert anti-atherogenic effects. In this review we provide an overview of oxysterol-driven gene expression regulation. We introduce nuclear receptors, in particular LXR, how they become activated by oxysterols, how they work, what consequences of receptor activation on transcription regulation has and how these processes coordinate cholesterol metabolism and transport in macrophages. We place LXR into a network of transcription factors, enzymes and ligands. We also summarize data supporting the notion that LXR is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes.

If instrumental variables for the exposure and mediator are available, direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated, for example using either a regression-based method or structural equation models. The direction of effect between the exposure and a possible mediator can also be assessed. Methods are illustrated in an applied example considering causal relationships between body mass index, C-reactive protein and uric acid., Results: These estimators are consistent in the presence of unmeasured confounding if, in addition to the instrumental variable assumptions, the effects of both the exposure on the mediator and the mediator on the outcome are homogeneous across individuals and linear without interactions. Nevertheless, a simulation study demonstrates that even considerable heterogeneity in these effects does not lead to bias in the estimates., Conclusions: These methods can be used to estimate direct and indirect causal effects in a mediation setting, and have potential for the investigation of more complex networks between multiple interrelated exposures and disease outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background

Foam cell formation by intimal smooth muscle cells (SMCs) inhibits the elaboration of extracellular matrix, which is detrimental to plaque stabilization. In the present study, we examined the lipoproteins and receptors involved in human SMC foam cell formation and investigated the ability of 24(S),25‐epoxycholesterol [24(S),25‐EC], an oxysterol agonist of the liver X receptor, to attenuate SMC foam cell formation.

Methods and Results

Incubation of human internal thoracic SMCs with atherogenic lipoproteins demonstrated that low‐density lipoprotein (LDL), but not oxidized or acetylated LDL, was the primary lipoprotein taken up, resulting in marked cholesteryl ester deposition (6‐fold vs 1.8‐fold; P{\textless}0.05; n=4). Exposure of SMCs to exogenous or endogenously synthesized 24(S),25‐EC attenuated LDL uptake (−90\% and −47\% respectively; P{\textless}0.05; n=3) through decreased sterol regulatory element–binding protein‐2 expression (−30\% and −17\%, respectively; P{\textless}0.001; n=3), decreased LDL receptor expression (−75\% and −40\%, respectively; P{\textless}0.05; n=3) and increased liver X receptor–mediated myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein expression (7‐ and 3‐fold, respectively; P{\textless}0.05; n=4). Furthermore, exogenous 24(S),25‐EC increased adenosine triphosphate–binding cassettes A1– and G1–mediated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein AI (1.9‐fold; P{\textless}0.001; n=5) and high‐density lipoprotein3 (1.3‐fold; P{\textless}0.05; n=5). 24(S),25‐EC, unlike a nonsteroidal liver X receptor agonist, T0901317, did not stimulate sterol regulatory element–binding protein‐1c–mediated fatty acid synthesis or triglyceride accumulation. 24(S),25‐EC preserved the assembly of fibronectin and type I collagen by SMCs.

Conclusions

The oxysterol 24(S),25‐EC prevented foam cell formation in human SMCs by attenuation of LDL receptor–mediated LDL uptake and stimulation of cholesterol efflux, restoring the elaboration of extracellular matrix. In contrast to T0901317, 24(S),25‐EC prevented the development of a triglyceride‐rich foam cell phenotype. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2012;1:e000810 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.112.000810.)},

They modulate the activity of two master transcription factors that control cholesterol homeostatic responses, sterol regulatory element–binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and liver X receptor (LXR). Although the role of exogenous oxysterols in regulating these transcription factors has been well established, whether endogenously synthesized oxysterols similarly control both SREBP-2 and LXR remains poorly explored. Here, we carefully validate the role of oxysterols enzymatically synthesized within cells in cholesterol homeostatic responses. We first show that SREBP-2 responds more sensitively to exogenous oxysterols than LXR in Chinese hamster ovary cells and rat primary hepatocytes. We then show that 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), 27-hydroxycholesterol, and 24S-hydroxycholesterol endogenously synthesized by CH25H, CYP27A1, and CYP46A1, respectively, suppress SREBP-2 activity at different degrees by stabilizing Insig (insulin-induced gene) proteins, whereas 7α-hydroxycholesterol has little impact on SREBP-2. These results demonstrate the role of site-specific hydroxylation of endogenous oxysterols. In contrast, the expression of CH25H, CYP46A1, CYP27A1, or CYP7A1 fails to induce LXR target gene expression. We also show the 25-HC production–dependent suppression of SREBP-2 using a tetracycline-inducible CH25H expression system. To induce 25-HC production physiologically, murine macrophages are stimulated with a Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, and its effect on SREBP-2 and LXR is examined. The results also suggest that \textit{de novo} synthesis of 25-HC preferentially regulates SREBP-2 activity. Finally, we quantitatively determine the specificity of the four cholesterol hydroxylases in living cells. Based on our current findings, we conclude that endogenous side-chain oxysterols primarily regulate the activity of SREBP-2, not LXR.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {IntroductionStatins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are commonly used cholesterol-lowering medications which are also increasingly recognized to have anti-cancer properties for various cancers, including breast cancer. Most clinical evidence supports a protective effect of statin on reducing breast cancer recurrence, particularly in hormone-receptor positive breast cancers.This study seeks to study the impact of statin use on breast cancer recurrence in an Asian population.MethodsThis is a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with breast cancer at the National Cancer Centre and Singapore General Hospital from 2005-2015. Statin use was defined as use after surgery. Associations between statin use, breast cancer recurrence and overall survival were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for age, TNM stage, grade, ER/HER2 status, and co-morbidities. Associations between statin-use and disease-specific survival were estimated using competing risks regression.ResultsA total of 7858 females with breast cancer were studied, 1353(17.2\%) were statin users, 6505(82.8\%) were non-statin users, with a median follow-up of 8.67 years. Distribution of cancer stage, histology, molecular subtypes and grades were similar in both groups. Estrogen receptor(ER) positive (HR 0.57,95\%CI 0.43-0.76,p{\textless}0.001) and HER2 negative (HR 0.74,95\%CI 0.57-0.96,p=0.026) invasive cancers had a lower risk of recurrence in statin users. Statin users trended towards a long term recurrence-risk reduction (all subtypes,HR 0.48,p=0.002; ER-, HR 0.34,p=0.036; HER2+,HR 0.10,p=0.002). The risk-reduction benefit is not appreciated in statin users with DCIS, possibly due to small recurrence event numbers. Disease-specific survival benefit was seen in statin users with ER+ cancers (adjusted SHR 0.71,95\%CI 0.53-0.96,p=0.027), especially ER+ invasive cancers (adjusted SHR 0.72, 95\%CI 0.53-0.97,p=0.028), but with no statistically significant benefit in overall survival for statin users (all subtypes).ConclusionThis is the first known retrospective study on the effect of statin use and breast cancer recurrence in an Asian population. Similar to previous international studies, statin use is associated with a risk reduction in breast cancer recurrence. This is especially beneficial in patients who have ER+ and HER2- invasive breast cancer. Statin use is also associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence in all subtypes of breast cancer in the long term ({\textgreater}6 years post diagnosis).},

	abstract = {Objective: To test the hypothesis that use of lipid-lowering drugs reduces the risk of breast cancer in older women.

Methods: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted at four community-based clinical centers in the United States, including 7528 Caucasian women, mean age 77 years. The main outcome measure was incident breast cancer confirmed by medical record and pathology reports identified over an average of 6.8 years (244 cases).

Results: The use of lipid-lowering drugs was reported by 576 women (7.7\%). The age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer was 3.1/1000 person-years among statin users, 1.4 among women using other lipid-lowering agents, and 5.0 among nonusers. After adjustment for age and body weight, the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer among statin users was 0.28 (95\% confidence intervals [CI] 0.09-0.86), and among women who used other lipid-lowering drugs, it was 0.37 (95\% CI 0.14-0.99) in comparison to nonusers. The combined group of lipid-lowering drug users had a 68\% reduction in the risk of breast cancer (95\% CI 32\%-85\%). Further adjustment for hormone use, family history of breast cancer, mammography use, or other risk factors did not alter the results.

Conclusions: Older women who use lipid-lowering drugs may have a reduced risk of breast cancer. Given the widespread use of statins in older women, these results could have a large public health impact. However, these findings need confirmation in other prospective studies, as they were based on a small number of breast cancer events.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that statins, an established drug group in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality, could delay or prevent breast cancer recurrence but the effect on disease-specific mortality remains unclear. We evaluated risk of breast cancer death among statin users in a population-based cohort of breast cancer patients. The study cohort included all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in Finland during 1995–2003 (31,236 cases), identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Information on statin use before and after the diagnosis was obtained from a national prescription database. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression method to estimate mortality among statin users with statin use as time-dependent variable. A total of 4,151 participants had used statins. During the median follow-up of 3.25 years after the diagnosis (range 0.08–9.0 years) 6,011 participants died, of which 3,619 (60.2\%) was due to breast cancer. After adjustment for age, tumor characteristics, and treatment selection, both post-diagnostic and pre-diagnostic statin use were associated with lowered risk of breast cancer death (HR 0.46, 95\% CI 0.38–0.55 and HR 0.54, 95\% CI 0.44–0.67, respectively). The risk decrease by post-diagnostic statin use was likely affected by healthy adherer bias; that is, the greater likelihood of dying cancer patients to discontinue statin use as the association was not clearly dose-dependent and observed already at low-dose/short-term use. The dose- and time-dependence of the survival benefit among pre-diagnostic statin users suggests a possible causal effect that should be evaluated further in a clinical trial testing statins’ effect on survival in breast cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Chronically elevated levels of fatty acids-FA can cause beta cell death in vitro. Beta cells vary in their individual susceptibility to FA-toxicity. Rat beta cells were previously shown to better resist FA-toxicity in conditions that increased triglyceride formation or mitochondrial and peroxisomal FA-oxidation, possibly reducing cytoplasmic levels of toxic FA-moieties. We now show that stearoyl-CoA desaturase-SCD is involved in this cytoprotective mechanism through its ability to transfer saturated FA into monounsaturated FA that are incorporated in lipids. In purified beta cells, SCD expression was induced by LXR- and PPARα-agonists, which were found to protect rat, mouse and human beta cells against palmitate toxicity. When their SCD was inhibited or silenced, the agonist-induced protection was also suppressed. A correlation between beta cell-SCD expression and susceptibility to palmitate was also found in beta cell preparations isolated from different rodent models. In mice with LXR-deletion (LXRβ-/- and LXRαβ-/-), beta cells presented a reduced SCD-expression as well as an increased susceptibility to palmitate-toxicity, which could not be counteracted by LXR or PPARα agonists. In Zucker fatty rats and in rats treated with the LXR-agonist TO1317, beta cells show an increased SCD-expression and lower palmitate-toxicity. In the normal rat beta cell population, the subpopulation with lower metabolic responsiveness to glucose exhibits a lower SCD1 expression and a higher susceptibility to palmitate toxicity. These data demonstrate that the beta cell susceptibility to saturated fatty acids can be reduced by stearoyl-coA desaturase, which upon stimulation by LXR and PPARα agonists favors their desaturation and subsequent incorporation in neutral lipids.},

However, obtaining reliable results from a Mendelian randomization investigation remains problematic, as the conventional inverse‐variance weighted method only gives consistent estimates if all of the genetic variants in the analysis are valid instrumental variables. We present a novel weighted median estimator for combining data on multiple genetic variants into a single causal estimate. This estimator is consistent even when up to 50\% of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables. In a simulation analysis, it is shown to have better finite‐sample Type 1 error rates than the inverse‐variance weighted method, and is complementary to the recently proposed MR‐Egger (Mendelian randomization‐Egger) regression method. In analyses of the causal effects of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary artery disease risk, the inverse‐variance weighted method suggests a causal effect of both lipid fractions, whereas the weighted median and MR‐Egger regression methods suggest a null effect of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol that corresponds with the experimental evidence. Both median‐based and MR‐Egger regression methods should be considered as sensitivity analyses for Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Estrogen receptor (ER) expression in breast cancer plays an essential role in carcinogenesis and disease progression. Recently, tumors with low level (1\%-10\%) of ER expression have been separately defined as ER low positive (ERlow). It is suggested that ERlow tumors might be morphologically and behaviorally different from tumors with high ER expression (ERhigh).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort database was performed. Patients who underwent curative surgery for early breast cancer and had available medical records were included for analysis. Difference in clinicopathological characteristics, endocrine responsiveness and five-year recurrence-free survival was evaluated between different ER subgroups (ERhigh, ERlow, and ER-negative [ER-]).
RESULTS: A total of 2,162 breast cancer patients were included in the analysis, Tis and T1 stage. Among them, 1,654 (76.5\%) were ERhigh, 54 (2.5\%) were ERlow, and 454 (21.0\%) were ER- patients. ERlow cases were associated with smaller size, higher histologic grade, positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, negative progesterone receptor, and higher Ki-67 expression. Recurrence rate was highest in ER- tumors and was inversely proportional to ER expression. Recurrence-free survival was not affected by hormonal therapy in the ERlow group (p=0.418).
CONCLUSION: ERlow breast cancer showed distinct clinicopathological features. ERlow tumors seemed to have higher recurrence rates compared to ERhigh tumors, and they showed no significant benefit from hormonal therapy. Future large scale prospective studies are necessary to validate the treatment options for ERlow breast cancer.},

HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) and LDL receptor (LDLR) mRNA levels increased less than 3-fold, whereas their protein levels increased 30- and 10-fold, respectively. Expression of inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL), an LXR-regulated gene that degrades LDLRs, was reduced 50\% by ezetimibe. Coadministration of ezetimibe with the LXR agonist T0901317 abolished the reduction in IDOL and prevented the increase in LDLR protein. Ezetimibe-stimulated LDLR expression was independent of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PSCK9), a protein that degrades LDLRs. To maintain cholesterol homeostasis in the face of ezetimibe, enterocytes boost LDL uptake by increasing LDLR number, and they boost sterol synthesis by increasing HMGR and other cholesterologenic genes. These studies reveal a hitherto undescribed homeostatic network in enterocytes triggered by blockade of cholesterol absorption.},

	abstract = {Disturbed cholesterol homeostasis plays critical roles in the development of multiple diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, particularly the CVD in which the accumulation of lipids (mainly the cholesteryl esters) within macrophage/foam cells underneath the endothelial layer drives the formation of atherosclerotic lesions eventually. More and more studies have shown that lowering cholesterol level, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, protects cardiovascular system and prevents cardiovascular events effectively. Maintaining cholesterol homeostasis is determined by cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake, efflux, transport, storage, utilization, and/or excretion. All the processes should be precisely controlled by the multiple regulatory pathways. Based on the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, many interventions have been developed to lower cholesterol by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake or enhancing cholesterol utilization and excretion. Herein, we summarize the historical review and research events, the current understandings of the molecular pathways playing key roles in regulating cholesterol homeostasis, and the cholesterol-lowering interventions in clinics or in preclinical studies as well as new cholesterol-lowering targets and their clinical advances. More importantly, we review and discuss the benefits of those interventions for the treatment of multiple diseases including atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, osteoporosis and virus infection.},

In the previous decades, the regulatory range of SREBPs has been markedly expanded. It was found that SREBPs also played a critical role in tumor development. SREBPs are involved in energy supply, lipid supply, immune environment and inflammatory environment shaping in tumor cells, and as a protective umbrella to support the malignant proliferation of tumor cells. Natural medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, as an important part of drug therapy, demonstrates the multifaceted effects of SREBPs regulation. This review summarizes the core processes in the involvement of SREBPs in tumors and provides a comprehensive understanding of the pathways through which natural drugs target the SREBP pathway and regulate tumor progression.},

Several enzymes are involved in estradiol metabolism, but few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to characterize the genetic contribution to variation in estrogen levels.Identify genetic loci affecting estradiol levels and estimate causal effect of estradiol on bone mineral density (BMD).We performed GWAS for estradiol in males (n = 147 690) and females (n = 163 985) from UK Biobank. Estradiol was analyzed as a binary phenotype above/below detection limit (175 pmol/L). We further estimated the causal effect of estradiol on BMD using Mendelian randomization.We identified 14 independent loci associated (P \&lt; 5 × 10−8) with estradiol levels in males, of which 1 (CYP3A7) was genome-wide and 7 nominally (P \&lt; 0.05) significant in females. In addition, 1 female-specific locus was identified. Most loci contain functionally relevant genes that have not been discussed in relation to estradiol levels in previous GWAS (eg, SRD5A2, which encodes a steroid 5-alpha reductase that is involved in processing androgens, and UGT3A1 and UGT2B7, which encode enzymes likely to be involved in estradiol elimination). The allele that tags the O blood group at the ABO locus was associated with higher estradiol levels. We identified a causal effect of high estradiol levels on increased BMD in both males (P = 1.58 × 10−11) and females (P = 7.48 × 10−6).Our findings further support the importance of the body’s own estrogen to maintain skeletal health in males and in females.},

Traditional, non-instrumental variable methods for mediation analysis experience a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding between an exposure, mediator and outcome and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation (MR) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with MR: multivariable MR (MVMR) and two-step MR. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, interactions between exposures and mediators and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although MR relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our simulations demonstrate that these methods are unaffected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both MVMR and two-step MR can be implemented in both individual-level MR and summary data MR. MR mediation methods require different assumptions to be made, compared with non-instrumental variable mediation methods. Where these assumptions are more plausible, MR can be used to improve causal inference in mediation analysis.},

This has motivated applied researchers to investigate mediation in settings where there is no evidence of a total effect. In this paper we provide analytical insight into the circumstances under which higher power of the test for the mediated effect vs. the test for the total effect can be expected in the absence of a direct effect. We argue that the acclaimed power gain is somewhat deceptive and comes with a big price. On the basis of the results, we recommend that when the primary interest lies in mediation only, a significant test for the total effect should not be used as a prerequisite for the test for the indirect effect. However, because the test for the indirect effect is vulnerable to bias when common causes of mediator and outcome are not measured or not accounted for, it should be evaluated in a sensitivity analysis.},

It is an instrumental variable analysis in which genetic variants are used as the instruments. Many consortia have meta-analysed genome-wide associations between variants and specific traits and made their results publicly available. Using such data, it is possible to derive genetic risk scores for one trait and to deduce the association of that same risk score with a second trait. The properties of this approach are investigated by simulation and by evaluating the potentially causal effect of birth weight on adult glucose level. In such analyses, it is important to decide whether one is interested in the risk score based on a set of estimated regression coefficients or the score based on the true underlying coefficients. MR is primarily concerned with the latter. Methods designed for the former question will under-estimate the variance if used for MR. This variance can be corrected but it needs to be done with care to avoid introducing bias. MR based on public data sources is useful and easy to perform, but care must be taken to avoid false precision or bias.},

Serum 27HC was analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in blood samples collected at study recruitment. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to quantify the association between circulating 27HC and breast cancer risk overall, by tumor hormone receptor status (ie estrogen and progesterone receptors), and by menopausal status at blood collection. All statistical tests were two-sided.27HC was not associated with breast cancer risk overall (relative risk [RR]Quartile4vsQuartile1 [Q4vsQ1] = 0.90, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66 to 1.22). The association between 27HC and breast cancer risk differed by menopausal status at blood collection (Phet = .02), but not by age at diagnosis (Phet = .78). Among women who were postmenopausal at blood collection, higher serum 27HC levels were associated with lower breast cancer risk (RRQ4vsQ1 = 0.56, 95\% CI = 0.36 to 0.87). We observed no association between 27HC and breast cancer risk (RRQ4vsQ1 = 1.33, 95\% CI = 0.75 to 2.38) among women who were premenopausal at blood collection.In this first prospective study, higher circulating 27HC was associated with lower risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

Design Mendelian randomisation study.
Setting UK Biobank and international genome-wide association study data.
Participants Predominantly participants of European ancestry.
Exposure Educational attainment, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour in observational analysis, and randomly allocated genetic variants to instrument these traits in mendelian randomisation.
Main outcomes measure The risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease (all subtypes; all measured in odds ratio), and the degree to which this is mediated through BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour respectively.
Results Each additional standard deviation of education (3.6 years) was associated with a 13\% lower risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.86, 95\% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.89) in observational analysis and a 37\% lower risk (0.63, 0.60 to 0.67) in mendelian randomisation analysis. As a proportion of the total risk reduction, BMI was estimated to mediate 15\% (95\% confidence interval 13\% to 17\%) and 18\% (14\% to 23\%) in the observational and mendelian randomisation estimates, respectively. Corresponding estimates were 11\% (9\% to 13\%) and 21\% (15\% to 27\%) for systolic blood pressure and 19\% (15\% to 22\%) and 34\% (17\% to 50\%) for smoking behaviour. All three risk factors combined were estimated to mediate 42\% (36\% to 48\%) and 36\% (5\% to 68\%) of the effect of education on coronary heart disease in observational and mendelian randomisation analyses, respectively. Similar results were obtained when investigating the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour mediate a substantial proportion of the protective effect of education on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and intervening on these would lead to reductions in cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to lower levels of education. However, more than half of the protective effect of education remains unexplained and requires further investigation.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12863-014-0088-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imputation of partially missing or unobserved genotypes is an indispensable tool for SNP data analyses. However, research and understanding of the impact of initial SNP-data quality control on imputation results is still limited. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the effect of different strategies of pre-imputation quality filtering on the performance of the widely used imputation algorithms MaCH and IMPUTE.
RESULTS: We considered three scenarios: imputation of partially missing genotypes with usage of an external reference panel, without usage of an external reference panel, as well as imputation of completely un-typed SNPs using an external reference panel. We first created various datasets applying different SNP quality filters and masking certain percentages of randomly selected high-quality SNPs. We imputed these SNPs and compared the results between the different filtering scenarios by using established and newly proposed measures of imputation quality. While the established measures assess certainty of imputation results, our newly proposed measures focus on the agreement with true genotypes. These measures showed that pre-imputation SNP-filtering might be detrimental regarding imputation quality. Moreover, the strongest drivers of imputation quality were in general the burden of missingness and the number of SNPs used for imputation. We also found that using a reference panel always improves imputation quality of partially missing genotypes. MaCH performed slightly better than IMPUTE2 in most of our scenarios. Again, these results were more pronounced when using our newly defined measures of imputation quality.
CONCLUSION: Even a moderate filtering has a detrimental effect on the imputation quality. Therefore little or no SNP filtering prior to imputation appears to be the best strategy for imputing small to moderately sized datasets. Our results also showed that for these datasets, MaCH performs slightly better than IMPUTE2 in most scenarios at the cost of increased computing time.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) studies typically assess the pathogenic relevance of environmental exposures or disease biomarkers, using genetic variants that instrument these exposures. The approach is gaining popularity—our systematic review reveals a greater than 10-fold increase in MR studies published between 2004 and 2015. When the MR paradigm was first proposed, few biomarker- or exposure-related genetic variants were known, most having been identified by candidate gene studies. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are now providing a rich source of potential instruments for MR analysis. Many early reviews covering the concept, applications and analytical aspects of the MR technique preceded the surge in GWAS, and thus the question of how best to select instruments for MR studies from the now extensive pool of available variants has received insufficient attention. Here we focus on the most common category of MR studies—those concerning disease biomarkers. We consider how the selection of instruments for MR analysis from GWAS requires consideration of: the assumptions underlying the MR approach; the biology of the biomarker; the genome-wide distribution, frequency and effect size of biomarker-associated variants (the genetic architecture); and the specificity of the genetic associations. Based on this, we develop guidance that may help investigators to plan and readers interpret MR studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess bodyweight, expressed as increased body-mass index (BMI), is associated with the risk of some common adult cancers. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the strength of associations between BMI and different sites of cancer and to investigate differences in these associations between sex and ethnic groups.
METHODS: We did electronic searches on Medline and Embase (1966 to November 2007), and searched reports to identify prospective studies of incident cases of 20 cancer types. We did random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions of study-specific incremental estimates to determine the risk of cancer associated with a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI.
FINDINGS: We analysed 221 datasets (141 articles), including 282,137 incident cases. In men, a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was strongly associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (RR 1.52, p{\textless}0.0001) and with thyroid (1.33, p=0.02), colon (1.24, p{\textless}0.0001), and renal (1.24, p {\textless}0.0001) cancers. In women, we recorded strong associations between a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI and endometrial (1.59, p{\textless}0.0001), gallbladder (1.59, p=0.04), oesophageal adenocarcinoma (1.51, p{\textless}0.0001), and renal (1.34, p{\textless}0.0001) cancers. We noted weaker positive associations (RR {\textless}1.20) between increased BMI and rectal cancer and malignant melanoma in men; postmenopausal breast, pancreatic, thyroid, and colon cancers in women; and leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in both sexes. Associations were stronger in men than in women for colon (p{\textless}0.0001) cancer. Associations were generally similar in studies from North America, Europe and Australia, and the Asia-Pacific region, but we recorded stronger associations in Asia-Pacific populations between increased BMI and premenopausal (p=0.009) and postmenopausal (p=0.06) breast cancers.
INTERPRETATION: Increased BMI is associated with increased risk of common and less common malignancies. For some cancer types, associations differ between sexes and populations of different ethnic origins. These epidemiological observations should inform the exploration of biological mechanisms that link obesity with cancer.},

Pooled analysis yielded a summary risk ratio of 0.78 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.67, 0.92) for hormone receptor-positive premenopausal breast cancer associated with obesity (body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) ≥30 compared with {\textless}25). Obesity was associated with a summary risk ratio of 1.39 (95\% CI: 1.14, 1.70) for receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer. For receptor-negative breast cancer, the summary risk ratios of 1.06 (95\% CI: 0.70, 1.60) and 0.98 (95\% CI: 0.78, 1.22) associated with obesity were null for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively. Elevated postmenopausal breast cancer risk ratios associated with obesity were limited to women who never took estrogen-progestin therapy, with risk ratios of 1.42 (95\% CI: 1.30, 1.55) among never users and 1.18 (95\% CI: 0.98, 1.42) among users; too few studies were available to examine this relationship according to receptor subtype. Future research is needed to confirm whether obesity is unrelated to receptor-negative breast cancer in populations of postmenopausal women with low prevalence of hormone medication use.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The association between increasing body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and risk of breast cancer is unique in cancer epidemiology in that a crossover effect exists, with risk reduction before and risk increase after menopause. The inverse association with premenopausal breast cancer risk is poorly characterized but might be important in the understanding of breast cancer causation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of BMI with premenopausal breast cancer risk, in particular by age at BMI, attained age, risk factors for breast cancer, and tumor characteristics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter analysis used pooled individual-level data from 758 592 premenopausal women from 19 prospective cohorts to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of premenopausal breast cancer in association with BMI from ages 18 through 54 years using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Median follow-up was 9.3 years (interquartile range, 4.9-13.5 years) per participant, with 13 082 incident cases of breast cancer. Participants were recruited from January 1, 1963, through December 31, 2013, and data were analyzed from September 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017.
EXPOSURES: Body mass index at ages 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 to 54 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Invasive or in situ premenopausal breast cancer.
RESULTS: Among the 758 592 premenopausal women (median age, 40.6 years; interquartile range, 35.2-45.5 years) included in the analysis, inverse linear associations of BMI with breast cancer risk were found that were stronger for BMI at ages 18 to 24 years (HR per 5 kg/m2 [5.0-U] difference, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.80) than for BMI at ages 45 to 54 years (HR per 5.0-U difference, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.86-0.91). The inverse associations were observed even among nonoverweight women. There was a 4.2-fold risk gradient between the highest and lowest BMI categories (BMI≥35.0 vs {\textless}17.0) at ages 18 to 24 years (HR, 0.24; 95\% CI, 0.14-0.40). Hazard ratios did not appreciably vary by attained age or between strata of other breast cancer risk factors. Associations were stronger for estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive than for hormone receptor-negative breast cancer for BMI at every age group (eg, for BMI at age 18 to 24 years: HR per 5.0-U difference for estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive tumors, 0.76 [95\% CI, 0.70-0.81] vs hormone receptor-negative tumors, 0.85 [95\% CI: 0.76-0.95]); BMI at ages 25 to 54 years was not consistently associated with triple-negative or hormone receptor-negative breast cancer overall.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that increased adiposity is associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer at a greater magnitude than previously shown and across the entire distribution of BMI. The strongest associations of risk were observed for BMI in early adulthood. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying these associations could have important preventive potential.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors are at increased risk for developing second primary cancers compared with the general population. Little is known about whether body mass index (BMI) increases this risk. We examined the association between BMI and second cancers among women with incident invasive breast cancer.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort included 6481 patients from Kaiser Permanente Colorado and Washington of whom 822 (12.7\%) developed a second cancer (mean follow-up was 88.0 months). BMI at the first cancer was extracted from the medical record. Outcomes included: 1) all second cancers, 2) obesity-related second cancers, 3) any second breast cancer, and 4) estrogen receptor-positive second breast cancers. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for second cancers associated with BMI adjusted for site, diagnosis year, treatment, demographic, and tumor characteristics.
RESULTS: The mean age at initial breast cancer diagnosis was 61.2 (SD = 11.8) years. Most cases were overweight (33.4\%) or obese (33.8\%) and diagnosed at stage I (62.0\%). In multivariable models, for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI, the risk of any second cancer diagnosis increased by 7\% (RR = 1.07, 95\% CI = 1.01 to 1.14); 13\% (RR = 1.13, 95\% CI = 1.05 to 1.21) for obesity-related cancers, 11\% (RR = 1.11, 95\% CI = 1.02 to 1.21) for a second breast cancer, and 15\% (RR = 1.15, 95\% CI = 1.04 to 1.27) for a second estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a statistically significant increased risk of second cancers associated with increasing BMI. These findings have important public health implications given the prevalence of overweight and obesity in breast cancer survivors and underscore the need for effective prevention strategies.},

	abstract = {An estimated 30-40\% of cancers can be prevented through changes in modifiable lifestyle and environmental risk factors known to be associated with cancer incidence. Despite this knowledge, there remains limited awareness that these associations exist. The purpose of this review article was to summarize the epidemiologic evidence concerning the contribution of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and obesity to cancer etiology and to provide an overview of the biologic mechanisms that may be operative between these factors and cancer incidence. Strong and consistent evidence exists that higher levels of physical activity reduce the risk of six different cancer sites (bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia), whereas moderate evidence inversely associates physical activity with lung, ovarian, pancreatic and renal cancer, and limited evidence inversely correlates physical activity with prostate cancer. Sedentary behavior, independent of physical activity, has been shown to increase the risk of colon, endometrial, and lung cancers. Obesity is an established risk factor for 13 different cancer sites (endometrial, postmenopausal breast, colorectal, esophageal, renal/kidneys, meningioma, pancreatic, gastric cardia, liver, multiple myeloma, ovarian, gallbladder, and thyroid). The main biologic mechanisms whereby physical activity, sedentary behavior, and obesity are related to cancer incidence include an effect on endogenous sex steroids and metabolic hormones, insulin sensitivity, and chronic inflammation. Several emerging pathways related to oxidative stress, DNA methylation, telomere length, immune function, and gut microbiome are presented. Key recommendations for future research in both the epidemiology and biology of the associations between physical activity, sedentary behavior, obesity, and cancer risk are also provided.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess body weight is an established cause of postmenopausal breast cancer, but it is unknown if weight loss reduces risk.
METHODS: Associations between weight change and risk of breast cancer were examined among women aged 50 years and older in the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer. In 10 cohorts, weight assessed on three surveys was used to examine weight change patterns over approximately 10 years (interval 1 median = 5.2 years; interval 2 median = 4.0 years). Sustained weight loss was defined as no less than 2 kg lost in interval 1 that was not regained in interval 2. Among 180 885 women, 6930 invasive breast cancers were identified during follow-up.
RESULTS: Compared with women with stable weight (±2 kg), women with sustained weight loss had a lower risk of breast cancer. This risk reduction was linear and specific to women not using postmenopausal hormones ({\textgreater}2-4.5 kg lost: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.82, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70 to 0.96; {\textgreater}4.5-{\textless}9 kg lost: HR = 0.75, 95\% CI = 0.63 to 0.90; ≥9 kg lost: HR = 0.68, 95\% CI = 0.50 to 0.93). Women who lost at least 9 kg and gained back some (but not all) of it were also at a lower risk of breast cancer. Other patterns of weight loss and gain over the two intervals had a similar risk of breast cancer to women with stable weight.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sustained weight loss, even modest amounts, is associated with lower breast cancer risk for women aged 50 years and older. Breast cancer prevention may be a strong weight-loss motivator for the two-thirds of American women who are overweight or obese.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate in this secondary analysis the associations of overweight and obesity with risk of postmenopausal invasive breast cancer after extended follow-up in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trials.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The WHI clinical trial protocol incorporated measured height and weight, baseline and annual or biennial mammography, and adjudicated breast cancer end points in 67 142 postmenopausal women ages 50 to 79 years at 40 US clinical centers. The women were enrolled from 1993 to 1998 with a median of 13 years of follow-up through 2010; 3388 invasive breast cancers were observed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Height and weight were measured at baseline, and weight was measured annually thereafter. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, personal and family medical history, and personal habits (smoking, physical activity). Women underwent annual or biennial mammograms. Breast cancers were verified by medical records reviewed by physician adjudicators.
RESULTS: Women who were overweight and obese had an increased invasive breast cancer risk vs women of normal weight. Risk was greatest for obesity grade 2 plus 3 (body mass index [BMI], calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, {\textgreater}35.0) (hazard ratio [HR] for invasive breast cancer, 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.40-1.79). A BMI of 35.0 or higher was strongly associated with risk for estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive breast cancers (HR, 1.86; 95\% CI, 1.60-2.17) but was not associated with estrogen receptor-negative cancers. Obesity grade 2 plus 3 was also associated with advanced disease, including larger tumor size (HR, 2.12; 95\% CI, 1.67-2.69; P = .02), positive lymph nodes (HR, 1.89; 95\% CI, 1.46-2.45; P = .06), regional and/or distant stage (HR, 1.94; 95\% CI, 1.52-2.47; P = .05), and deaths after breast cancer (HR, 2.11; 95\% CI, 1.57-2.84; P {\textless} .001). Women with a baseline BMI of less than 25.0 who gained more than 5\% of body weight over the follow-up period had an increased breast cancer risk (HR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.65), but among women already overweight or obese we found no association of weight change (gain or loss) with breast cancer during follow-up. There was no effect modification of the BMI-breast cancer relationship by postmenopausal hormone therapy, and the direction of association across BMI categories was similar for never, past, and current hormone therapy use.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Obesity is associated with increased invasive breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. These clinically meaningful findings should motivate programs for obesity prevention.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that overweight and obese breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of cancer recurrence and have higher all-cause mortality. Obesity has an impact on breast cancer survivor's quality of life (QOL) and increases the risk of longer-term morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Many cancer guidelines recommend survivors maintain a healthy weight but there is a lack of evidence regarding which weight loss method to recommend.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of different body weight loss approaches in breast cancer survivors who are overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2).
SEARCH METHODS: We carried out a search in the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's (CBCG's) Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 6), MEDLINE (2012 to June 2019), Embase (2015 to June 2019), the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and Clinicaltrials.gov on 17 June 2019. We also searched Mainland Chinese academic literature databases (CNKI), VIP, Wan Fang Data and SinoMed on 25 June 2019. We screened references in relevant manuscripts.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and randomised cross-over trials evaluating body weight management for overweight and obese breast cancer survivors (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2). The aim of the intervention had to be weight loss.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias for the included studies, and applied the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Dichotomous outcomes were analysed as proportions using the risk ratio (RR) as the measure of effect. Continuous data were analysed as means with the measure of effect being expressed as the mean differences (MDs) between treatment groups in change from baseline values with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), when all studies reported exactly the same outcomes on the same scale. If similar outcomes were reported on different scales the standardised mean difference (SMD) was used as the measure of effect. Quality of life data and relevant biomarkers were extracted where available.
MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 20 studies (containing 23 intervention-comparisons) and analysed 2028 randomised women. Participants in the experimental groups received weight loss interventions using the core element of dietary changes, either in isolation or in combination with other core elements such as 'diet and exercise', 'diet and psychosocial support' or 'diet, exercise and psychosocial support'. Participants in the controls groups either received usual care, written materials or placebo, or wait-list controls. The duration of interventions ranged from 0.5 months to 24 months. The duration of follow-up ranged from three months to 36 months. There were no time-to-event data available for overall survival, breast cancer recurrence and disease-free survival. There was a relatively small amount of data available for breast cancer recurrence (281 participants from 4 intervention-comparisons with 14 recurrence events; RR 1.95, 95\% CI 0.68 to 5.60; low-quality evidence) and the analysis was likely underpowered. Overall, we found low-quality evidence that weight loss interventions for overweight and obese breast cancer survivors resulted in a reduction in body weight (MD: -2.25 kg, 95\% CI: -3.19 to -1.3 kg; 21 intervention-comparisons; 1751 women), body mass index (BMI) (MD: -1.08 kg/m2, 95\% CI: -1.61 to -0.56 kg/m2; 17 intervention-comparisons; 1353 women), and waist circumference (MD:-1.73 cm, 95\% CI: -3.17 to -0.29 cm; 13 intervention-comparisons; 1193 women), and improved overall quality of life (SMD: 0.74; 95\% CI: 0.20 to 1.29; 10 intervention-comparisons; 867 women). No increase was seen in adverse events for women in the intervention groups compared to controls (RR 0.94, 95\% CI: 0.76 to 1.17; 4 intervention-comparisons; 394 women; high-quality evidence). Subgroup analyses revealed that decreases in body weight, BMI and waist circumference were present in women regardless of their ethnicity and menopausal status. Multimodal weight loss interventions (which referred to 'diet, exercise and psychosocial support') appeared to result in greater reductions in body weight (MD: -2.88 kg, 95\% CI: -3.98 to -1.77 kg; 13 intervention-comparisons; 1526 participants), BMI (MD: -1.44 kg/m2, 95\% CI: -2.16 to -0.72 kg/m2; 11 studies; 1187 participants) and waist circumference (MD:-1.66 cm, 95\% CI: -3.49 to -0.16 cm; 8 intervention-comparisons; 1021 participants) compared to dietary change alone, however the evidence was low quality.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss interventions, particularly multimodal interventions (incorporating diet, exercise and psychosocial support), in overweight or obese breast cancer survivors appear to result in decreases in body weight, BMI and waist circumference and improvement in overall quality of life. There was no increase in adverse events. There is a lack of data to determine the impact of weight loss interventions on survival or breast cancer recurrence. This review is based on studies with marked heterogeneity regarding weight loss interventions. Due to the methods used in included studies, there was a high risk of bias regarding blinding of participants and assessors. Further research is required to determine the optimal weight loss intervention and assess the impact of weight loss on survival outcomes. Long-term follow-up in weight loss intervention studies is required to determine if weight changes are sustained beyond the intervention periods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elevated body mass index (BMI) represents a risk factor for cancer-related fatigue (CRF). Weight loss interventions are feasible and safe in cancer survivors, leading to improved cardio-metabolic and quality of life (QOL) outcomes and modulating inflammatory biomarkers. Randomized data are lacking showing that a lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss, combining improved diet, exercise, and motivational counseling, reduces CRF. Motivating to Exercise and Diet, and Educating to healthy behaviors After breast cancer (MEDEA) is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of weight loss on CRF in overweight or obese survivors of breast cancer. Herein, we described the MEDEA methodology.
METHODS: Patients (N = 220) with stage I-III breast cancer and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, within 12 months of primary treatment, and able to walk ≥ 400 m are eligible to enroll. Participants are randomized 1:1 to health education alone vs. a personalized telephone-based weight loss intervention plus health education. Both arms receive a health education program focusing on healthy living. Patients in the intervention arm are paired with an individual lifestyle coach, who delivers the intervention through 24 semi-structured telephone calls over 1 year. Intervention goals include weight loss ≥ 10\% of baseline, caloric restriction of 500-1000 Kcal/day, and increased physical activity (PA) to 150 (initial phase) and 225-300 min/week (maintenance phase). The intervention is based on the social cognitive theory and is adapted from the Breast Cancer Weight Loss trial (BWEL, A011401). The primary endpoint is the difference in self-reported CRF (EORTC QLQ-C30) between arms. Secondary endpoints include the following: QOL (EORTC QLQ-C30, -BR45, -FA12), anxiety, and depression (HADS); weight and BMI, dietary habits and quality, PA, and sleep; health care costs (hospital-admissions, all-drug consumption, sick leaves) and cost-effectiveness (cost per quality-adjusted life-year); and patient motivation and satisfaction. The primary analysis of MEDEA will compare self-reported CRF at 12 months post-randomization between arms, with 80.0\% power (two-sided α = 0.05) to detect a standardized effect size of 0.40.
DISCUSSION: MEDEA will test the impact of a weight loss intervention on CRF among overweight or obese BC survivors, potentially providing additional management strategies and contributing to establish weight loss support as a new standard of clinical care.

	abstract = {Body fat distribution is a heritable trait and a well-established predictor of adverse metabolic outcomes, independent of overall adiposity. To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of body fat distribution and its molecular links to cardiometabolic traits, here we conduct genome-wide association meta-analyses of traits related to waist and hip circumferences in up to 224,459 individuals. We identify 49 loci (33 new) associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (BMI), and an additional 19 loci newly associated with related waist and hip circumference measures (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)). In total, 20 of the 49 waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI loci show significant sexual dimorphism, 19 of which display a stronger effect in women. The identified loci were enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue and for putative regulatory elements in adipocytes. Pathway analyses implicated adipogenesis, angiogenesis, transcriptional regulation and insulin resistance as processes affecting fat distribution, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
This paper reviews and updates the evidence on the associations between physical activity and risk for cancer, and for mortality in persons with cancer, as presented in the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report.

Methods:
Systematic reviews of meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and pooled analyses were conducted through December 2016. An updated systematic review of such reports plus original research through February 2018 was conducted. This paper also identifies future research needs.

Results:
In reviewing 45 reports comprising hundreds of epidemiologic studies with several million study participants, the report found strong evidence for an association between highest versus lowest physical activity levels and reduced risks of bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, esophageal adenocarcinoma, renal, and gastric cancers. Relative risk reductions ranged from approximately 10 to 20 percent. Based on 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the report also found moderate or limited associations between greater amounts of physical activity and decreased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in individuals with a diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer, with relative risk reductions ranging almost up to 40 to 50 percent. The updated search, with 5 meta-analyses and 25 source papers reviewed, confirmed these findings.

Conclusions:
Levels of physical activity recommended in the 2018 Guidelines are associated with reduced risk and improved survival for several cancers. More research is needed to determine the associations between physical activity and incidence for less common cancers and associations with survival for other cancers. Future studies of cancer incidence and mortality should consider these associations for population subgroups, to determine dose-response relationships between physical activity and cancer risk and prognosis, and to establish mechanisms to explain these associations.},

	abstract = {Cancer incidences are rising globally. Therefore, in order to prevent and treat cancer, understanding cancer pathology is crucial. Tumors reprogram their metabolic phenotype to meet their needs for bioenergy, biosynthesis, and redox control. Alteration of the metabolic pathway has been proposed as the hallmark of cancer and explains the distinction between normal and cancer cells concerning nutrient utilization. Changes in the metabolism of nutrients such as glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid are associated with cancer risk. Luckily, this can be controlled with lifestyle modifications. Improvements in lifestyle behaviors to reduce cancer risks include a healthy diet, calorie restriction, and regular physical activity. This review begins with the understandings of metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Then, there will be evidence on the correlation between lifestyle factors and altered nutrient metabolism suggesting an application of lifestyle intervention for cancer risk reduction.},

	abstract = {Statin use is associated with increased calorie intake and consequent weight gain. It is speculated that statin‐dependent improvements in lipid profile may undermine the perceived need to follow lipid‐lowering and other dietary recommendations leading consequently to increased calorie intake. However, increases in calorie intake in statin users may also be related to statin‐dependent decreases in satiety factors such as leptin, an adipocyte‐derived adipokine. The objective of our study was to examine the direct effects of statins on leptin expression. Adipocytes are the main source of circulating leptin. Therefore, we examined the effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin on leptin expression in cultured human white adipocytes. We show that treatment of white adipocytes with simvastatin and atorvastatin decreases leptin mRNA expression (simvastatin: P = 0.008, atorvastatin: P = 0.03) and leptin secretion (simvastatin: P = 0.0001, atorvastatin: P = 0.0001). Both simvastatin and atorvastatin mediate decreases in leptin expression via extracellular‐signal‐regulated kinases 1/2 and peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma pathways (simvastatin: P = 0.01, atorvastatin: P = 0.026). Additionally, statin treatment also induced expected increases in adiponectin, while decreasing monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) mRNA. Furthermore, statins increased secretion of both total as well as high molecular weight adiponectin while decreasing MCP1 secretion. To conclude, statins act directly on human white adipocytes to regulate adipokine secretion and decrease leptin expression. Leptin is an important satiety factor. Hence, statin‐dependent decreases in leptin may contribute, at least in part, to increases in food intake in statin users.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Both dietary modification and use of statins can lower blood cholesterol. The increase in caloric intake among the general population is reported to have plateaued in the last decade, but no study has examined the relationship between the time trends of caloric intake and statin use.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the difference in the temporal trends of caloric and fat intake between statin users and nonusers among US adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A repeated cross-sectional study in a nationally representative sample of 27,886 US adults, 20 years or older, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 through 2010.
EXPOSURES: Statin use.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Caloric and fat intake measured through 24-hour dietary recall. Generalized linear models with interaction term between survey cycle and statin use were constructed to investigate the time trends of dietary intake for statin users and nonusers after adjustment for possible confounders. We calculated model-adjusted caloric and fat intake using these models and examined if the time trends differed by statin use. Body mass index (BMI) changes were also compared between statin users and nonusers.
RESULTS: In the 1999-2000 period, the caloric intake was significantly less for statin users compared with nonusers (2000 vs 2179 kcal/d; P = .007). The difference between the groups became smaller as time went by, and there was no statistical difference after the 2005-2006 period. Among statin users, caloric intake in the 2009-2010 period was 9.6\% higher (95\% CI, 1.8-18.1; P = .02) than that in the 1999-2000 period. In contrast, no significant change was observed among nonusers during the same study period. Statin users also consumed significantly less fat in the 1999-2000 period (71.7 vs 81.2 g/d; P = .003). Fat intake increased 14.4\% among statin users (95\% CI, 3.8-26.1; P = .007) while not changing significantly among nonusers. Also, BMI increased more among statin users (+1.3) than among nonusers (+0.4) in the adjusted model (P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Caloric and fat intake have increased among statin users over time, which was not true for nonusers. The increase in BMI was faster for statin users than for nonusers. Efforts aimed at dietary control among statin users may be becoming less intensive. The importance of dietary composition may need to be reemphasized for statin users.},

Mevalonate metabolites affect transcriptional and post-transcriptional events that in turn affect various biological processes including energy metabolism. In the present study, we examine whether mevalonate metabolites activate PPARγ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ), a ligand-dependent transcription factor playing a central role in adipocyte differentiation. In the luciferase reporter assay using both GAL4 chimaera and full-length PPARγ systems, a mevalonate metabolite, FPP (farnesyl pyrophosphate), which is the precursor of almost all isoprenoids and is positioned at branch points leading to the synthesis of other longer-chain isoprenoids, activated PPARγ in a dose-dependent manner. FPP induced the in vitro binding of a co-activator, SRC-1 (steroid receptor co-activator-1), to GST (glutathione transferase)-PPARγ. Direct binding of FPP to PPARγ was also indicated by docking simulation studies. Moreover, the addition of FPP up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of PPARγ target genes during adipocyte differentiation induction. In the presence of lovastatin, an HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) reductase inhibitor, both intracellular FPP levels and PPARγ-target gene expressions were decreased. In contrast, the increase in intracellular FPP level after the addition of zaragozic acid, a squalene synthase inhibitor, induced PPARγ-target gene expression. The addition of FPP and zaragozic acid promotes lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation. These findings indicated that FPP might function as an endogenous PPARγ agonist and regulate gene expression in adipocytes.},

	abstract = {The mevalonate pathway is essential for the synthesis of isoprenoids and cholesterol. Adipose tissue is known as a major site for cholesterol storage; however, the role of the local mevalonate pathway and its synthesized isoprenoids remains unclear. In this study, adipose-specific mevalonate pathway-disrupted (aKO) mice were generated through knockout of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGCR). aKO mice showed serious lipodystrophy accompanied with glucose and lipid metabolic disorders and hepatomegaly. These metabolic variations in aKO mice were dramatically reversed after fat transplantation. In addition, HMGCR-disrupted adipocytes exhibited loss of lipid accumulation and an increase of cell death, which were ameliorated by the supplementation of mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not farnesyl pyrophosphate and squalene. Finally, we found that apoptosis may be involved in adipocyte death induced by HMGCR down-regulation. Our findings indicate that the mevalonate pathway is essential for adipocytes and further suggest that this pathway is an important regulator of adipocyte turnover.,

We show here that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the mevalonate pathway leads to reduced human and mouse brown adipocyte function in vitro and impaired adipose tissue browning in vivo. A retrospective analysis of a large patient cohort suggests an inverse correlation between statin use and active BAT in humans, while we show in a prospective clinical trial that fluvastatin reduces thermogenic gene expression in human BAT. We identify geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate as the key mevalonate pathway intermediate driving adipocyte browning in vitro and in vivo, whose effects are mediated by geranylgeranyltransferases (GGTases), enzymes catalyzing geranylgeranylation of small GTP-binding proteins, thereby regulating YAP1/TAZ signaling through F-actin modulation. Conversely, adipocyte-specific ablation of GGTase I leads to impaired adipocyte browning, reduced energy expenditure, and glucose intolerance under obesogenic conditions, highlighting the importance of this pathway in modulating brown adipocyte functionality and systemic metabolism.},

Cholesterol is a key component of lipid rafts, which are the major platforms for signaling regulation in cancer, and chelating membrane cholesterol is an effective anti-cancer strategy that disrupts the functions of lipid rafts. Cholesterol metabolism is often reprogrammed in cancer cells. Targeting cholesterol metabolism as a new therapeutic approach has received increasing attention.

By developing methodologies to integrate information across multiple algorithms and diverse data sources we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million SNPs, 1.4 million indels and over 14 thousand larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways and that each individual harbours hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as transcription-factor-motif disrupting changes. This resource, which captures up to 98\% of accessible SNPs at a frequency of 1\% in populations of medical genetics focus, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

Given that the dyslipidemia-related autoimmune diseases are caused by autoreactive T cells and B cells, dyslipidemia seems to directly or indirectly regulate the adaptive immunity. Indeed, accumulating evidence has unveiled that proatherogenic factors can impact the differentiation and function of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells.

	abstract = {Obesity is a chronic, relapsing condition characterized by excess body fat. Its prevalence has increased globally since the 1970s, and the number of obese and overweight people is now greater than those underweight. Obesity is a multifactorial condition, and as such, many components contribute to its development and pathogenesis. This is the first of three companion reviews that consider obesity. This review focuses on the genetics, viruses, insulin resistance, inflammation, gut microbiome, and circadian rhythms that promote obesity, along with hormones, growth factors, and organs and tissues that control its development. It shows that the regulation of energy balance (intake vs. expenditure) relies on the interplay of a variety of hormones from adipose tissue, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and brain. It details how integrating central neurotransmitters and peripheral metabolic signals (e.g., leptin, insulin, ghrelin, peptide YY3-36) is essential for controlling energy homeostasis and feeding behavior. It describes the distinct types of adipocytes and how fat cell development is controlled by hormones and growth factors acting via a variety of receptors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, retinoid X, insulin, estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, thyroid hormone, liver X, constitutive androstane, pregnane X, farnesoid, and aryl hydrocarbon receptors. Finally, it demonstrates that obesity likely has origins in utero. Understanding these biochemical drivers of adiposity and metabolic dysfunction throughout the life cycle lends plausibility and credence to the "obesogen hypothesis" (i.e., the importance of environmental chemicals that disrupt these receptors to promote adiposity or alter metabolism), elucidated more fully in the two companion reviews.},

	abstract = {Observational studies have reported inconsistent associations between circulating lipids and breast cancer risk. Using results from {\textgreater}400,000 participants in two-sample Mendelian randomization, we show that genetically raised LDL-cholesterol is associated with higher risk of breast cancer (odds ratio, OR, per standard deviation, 1.09, 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-1.18, P = 0.020) and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (OR 1.14 [1.05-1.24] P = 0.004). Genetically raised HDL-cholesterol is associated with higher risk of ER-positive breast cancer (OR 1.13 [1.01-1.26] P = 0.037). HDL-cholesterol-raising variants in the gene encoding the target of CETP inhibitors are associated with higher risk of breast cancer (OR 1.07 [1.03-1.11] P = 0.001) and ER-positive breast cancer (OR 1.08 [1.03-1.13] P = 0.001). LDL-cholesterol-lowering variants mimicking PCSK9 inhibitors are associated (P = 0.014) with lower breast cancer risk. We find no effects related to the statin and ezetimibe target genes. The possible risk-promoting effects of raised LDL-cholesterol and CETP-mediated raised HDL-cholesterol have implications for breast cancer prevention and clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Associations between bladder cancer risk and NAT2 and GSTM1 polymorphisms have emerged as some of the most consistent findings in the genetic epidemiology of common metabolic polymorphisms and cancer, but their interaction with tobacco use, intensity and duration remain unclear. In a New England population-based case–control study of urothelial carcinoma, we collected mouthwash samples from 1088 of 1171 cases (92.9\%) and 1282 of 1418 controls (91.2\%) for genotype analysis of GSTM1 , GSTT1 and NAT2 polymorphisms. Odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals of bladder cancer among New England Bladder Cancer Study subjects with one or two inactive GSTM1 alleles (i.e. the ‘null’ genotype) were 1.26 (0.85–1.88) and 1.54 (1.05–2.25), respectively ( P -trend = 0.008), compared with those with two active copies. GSTT1 inactive alleles were not associated with risk. NAT2 slow acetylation status was not associated with risk among never (1.04; 0.71–1.51), former (0.95; 0.75–1.20) or current smokers (1.33; 0.91–1.95); however, a relationship emerged when smoking intensity was evaluated. Among slow acetylators who ever smoked at least 40 cigarettes/day, risk was elevated among ever (1.82; 1.14–2.91, P -interaction = 0.07) and current heavy smokers (3.16; 1.22–8.19, P -interaction = 0.03) compared with rapid acetylators in each category; but was not observed at lower intensities. In contrast, the effect of GSTM1 -null genotype was not greater among smokers, regardless of intensity. Meta-analysis of the NAT2 associations with bladder cancer showed a highly significant relationship. Findings from this large USA population-based study provided evidence that the NAT2 slow acetylation genotype interacts with tobacco smoking as a function of exposure intensity.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of two previously published genome-wide scans (4501 cases and 6076 controls of European background) and followed up the most significant association signals [17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genomic regions] in 1382 cases and 2201 controls from four studies. A combined analysis adjusted for study center, age, sex, and smoking status identified a novel susceptibility locus that mapped to a region of 18q12.3, marked by rs7238033 (P = 8.7 × 10–9; allelic odds ratio 1.20 with 95\% CI: 1.13–1.28) and two highly correlated SNPs, rs10775480/rs10853535 (r2= 1.00; P = 8.9 × 10–9; allelic odds ratio 1.16 with 95\% CI: 1.10–1.22). The signal localizes to the solute carrier family 14 member 1 gene, SLC14A1, a urea transporter that regulates cellular osmotic pressure. In the kidney, SLC14A1 regulates urine volume and concentration whereas in erythrocytes it determines the Kidd blood groups. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in SLC14A1 could provide new etiological insights into bladder carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Background
Many reported associations between common genetic polymorphisms and complex diseases have not been confirmed in subsequent studies. An exception could be the association between NAT2 slow acetylation, GSTM1 null genotype, and bladder-cancer risk. However, current evidence is based on meta-analyses of relatively small studies (range 23–374 cases) with some evidence of publication bias and study heterogeneity. Associations between polymorphisms in other NAT and GST genes and bladder-cancer risk have been inconsistent.
Methods
We investigated polymorphisms in NAT2, GSTM1, NAT1, GSTT1, GSTM3, and GSTP1 in 1150 patients with transitional-cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and 1149 controls in Spain; all the participants were white. We also carried out meta-analyses of NAT2, GSTM1, and bladder cancer that included more than twice as many cases as in previous reports.
Findings
In our study, the odds ratios for bladder cancer for individuals with deletion of one or two copies of the GSTM1 gene were 1·2 (95\% CI 0·8–1·7) and 1·9 (1·4–2·7) respectively (p for trend {\textless}0·0001). Compared with NAT2 rapid or intermediate acetylators, NAT2 slow acetylators had an increased overall risk of bladder cancer (1·4 [1·2–1·7]) that was stronger for cigarette smokers than for never smokers (p for interaction 0·008). No significant associations were found with the other polymorphisms. Meta-analyses showed that the overall association for NAT2 was robust (p{\textless}0·0001), and case-only meta-analyses provided support for an interaction between NAT2 and smoking (p for interaction 0·009). The overall association for GSTM1 was also robust (p{\textless}0·0001) and was not modified by smoking status (p=0·86).
Interpretation
The GSTM1 null genotype increases the overall risk of bladder cancer, and the NAT2 slow-acetylator genotype increases risk particularly among cigarette smokers. These findings provide compelling evidence for the role of common polymorphisms in the aetiology of cancer.
Relevance to practice
Although the relative risks are modest, these polymorphisms could account for up to 31\% of bladder cancers because of their high prevalence.},

	abstract = {Background
Genomic regions identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for bladder cancer risk provide new insights into etiology.
Objective
To identify new susceptibility variants for bladder cancer in a meta-analysis of new and existing genome-wide genotype data.
Design, setting, and participants
Data from 32 studies that includes 13,790 bladder cancer cases and 343,502 controls of European ancestry were used for meta-analysis.
Outcome measurements and statistical analyses
Log-additive associations of genetic variants were assessed using logistic regression models. A fixed-effects model was used for meta-analysis of the results. Stratified analyses were conducted to evaluate effect modification by sex and smoking status. A polygenic risk score (PRS) was generated on the basis of known and novel susceptibility variants and tested for interaction with smoking.
Results and limitations
Multiple novel bladder cancer susceptibility loci (6p.22.3, 7q36.3, 8q21.13, 9p21.3, 10q22.1, 19q13.33) as well as improved signals in three known regions (4p16.3, 5p15.33, 11p15.5) were identified, bringing the number of independent markers at genome-wide significance (p {\textless} 5 × 10−8) to 24. The 4p16.3 (FGFR3/TACC3) locus was associated with a stronger risk for women than for men (p-interaction = 0.002). Bladder cancer risk was increased by interactions between smoking status and genetic variants at 8p22 (NAT2; multiplicative p value for interaction [pM-I] = 0.004), 8q21.13 (PAG1; pM-I = 0.01), and 9p21.3 (LOC107987026/MTAP/CDKN2A; pM-I = 0.02). The PRS based on the 24 independent GWAS markers (odds ratio per standard deviation increase 1.49, 95\% confidence interval 1.44–1.53), which also showed comparable results in two prospective cohorts (UK Biobank, PLCO trial), revealed an approximately fourfold difference in the lifetime risk of bladder cancer according to the PRS (e.g., 1st vs 10th decile) for both smokers and nonsmokers.
Conclusions
We report novel loci associated with risk of bladder cancer that provide clues to its biological underpinnings. Using 24 independent markers, we constructed a PRS to stratify lifetime risk. The PRS combined with smoking history, and other established risk factors, has the potential to inform future screening efforts for bladder cancer.
Patient summary
We identified new genetic markers that provide biological insights into the genetic causes of bladder cancer. These genetic risk factors combined with lifestyle risk factors, such as smoking, may inform future preventive and screening strategies for bladder cancer.},

	abstract = {Background:
By-products are formed when disinfectants react with organic matter in source water. The most common class of disinfection by-products, trihalomethanes (THMs), have been linked to bladder cancer. Several studies have shown exposure–response associations with THMs in drinking water and bladder cancer risk. Few epidemiologic studies have evaluated gene–environment interactions for total THMs (TTHMs) with known bladder cancer susceptibility variants.

Objectives:
In this study, we investigated the combined effect on bladder cancer risk contributed by TTHMs, bladder cancer susceptibility variants identified through genome-wide association studies, and variants in several candidate genes.

Methods:
We analyzed data from two large case–control studies—the New England Bladder Cancer Study (n/n=989 cases/1,162 controls), a population-based study, and the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study (n/n=706 cases/772 controls), a hospital-based study. Because of differences in exposure distributions and metrics, we estimated effects of THMs and genetic variants within each study separately using adjusted logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) with and without interaction terms, and then combined the results using meta-analysis.

Results:
Of the 16 loci showing strong evidence of association with bladder cancer, rs907611 at 11p15.5 [leukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1 region)] showed the strongest associations in the highest exposure category in each study, with evidence of interaction in both studies and in meta-analysis. In the highest exposure category, we observed OR=1.66 (95\% CI: 1.17, 2.34, p-trend=0.005) for those with the rs907611-GG genotype and p-interaction=0.02. No other genetic variants tested showed consistent evidence of interaction.

Discussion:
We found novel suggestive evidence for a multiplicative interaction between a putative bladder carcinogen, TTHMs, and genotypes of rs907611. Given the ubiquitous exposure to THMs, further work is needed to replicate and extend this finding and to understand potential molecular mechanisms. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9895},

	doi = {10.1186/s12881-020-01172-1},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Though bladder cancer has been the subject of many well-powered genome-wide association studies, the mechanisms involving bladder-cancer-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remain largely unknown. This study focuses on rs798766, rs401681, rs2294008, and rs8102137, which have been associated with bladder cancer and are also cis-acting methylation quantitative loci (mQTL).
METHODS: Among 412 bladder cancer cases and 424 controls from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), we assessed whether the effects of these SNPs on bladder cancer are mediated through proximal DNA methylation changes in pre-diagnostic blood at mQTL-associated CpG sites, which we refer to as natural indirect effects (NIEs). We used a multiple-mediator mediation model for each of the four mQTL adjusted for matching variables and potential confounders, including race/ethnicity, smoking status, and pack-years of smoking.
RESULTS: While not statistically significant, our results suggest that substantial proportions of the modest effects of rs401681 (ORNIE = 1.05, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.89 to 1.25; NIE percent = 98.5\%) and rs2294008 (ORNIE = 1.10, 95\% CI = 0.90 to 1.33; NIE percent = 77.6\%) on bladder cancer risk are mediated through differential DNA methylation at nearby mQTL-associated CpG sites. The suggestive results indicate that rs2294008 may affect bladder cancer risk through a set of genes in the lymphocyte antigen 6 family, which involves genes that bind to and modulate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. There was no suggestive evidence supporting mediation for rs8102137 and rs798766.
CONCLUSIONS: Though larger studies are necessary, the methylation changes associated with rs401681 and rs2294008 at mQTL-associated CpG sites may be relevant for bladder carcinogenesis, and this study demonstrates how multi-omic data can be integrated to help understand the downstream effects of genetics variants.},

	abstract = {Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) instillation is a key therapy to manage non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, intravesical BCG therapy fails in approximately half of the patients, leading to recurrence and progression. We aimed to reveal the genetic variations associated with treatment failure after intravesical BCG therapy for NMIBC. This study included 91 Japanese patients treated with BCG instillation for NMIBC. Genomic DNA was obtained from patient whole-blood samples, and a genome-wide association study and genotyping for target regions were performed. The association between genetic variation and treatment failure was analyzed by genome-wide association in 44 patients as the discovery cohort. As a validation study, candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined among 47 patients in another cohort. The genome-wide association study indicated 19 candidate SNPs (rs1607282, rs7825442, rs1319325, rs3738088, rs4250, rs11894207, rs161448, rs2764326, rs2814707, rs3787194, rs58081719, rs3095966, rs73520681, rs16877113, rs16887173, rs10269584, rs11772249, rs118137814, and rs61094339) associated with BCG failure. Following the cumulative analysis of candidate SNPs, 2-gene (rs73520681 and rs61094339) and 4-gene (rs4250, rs11894207, rs73520681, and rs61094339) models successfully predicted treatment failure after intravesical BCG therapy. This study showed that several SNPs were possibly associated with outcome after intravesical BCG therapy in a Japanese population with NMIBC. The cumulative models of these SNPs may have value in clinical applications, although this should be confirmed in future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) causes a considerable health burden due to the high recurrence and progression rates. Past studies have identified multiple candidate loci associated with NMIBC prognosis, albeit lacking validation. Moreover, scarce reports exist on genetic susceptibility to independent prognostic predictors of NMIBC, such as stage or grade.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate genetic associations with NMIBC tumour and patient characteristics at the time of diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 653 NMIBC cases comes from the Bladder Cancer Prognosis Programme. Replication of the significant findings was conducted in the Nijmegen Bladder Cancer Study cohort (N=1470).
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was carried out for outcomes of tumour size (as a continuous variable in centimetres), stage (Tis and T1 vs Ta), grade (G3 vs G2 and G1), and age (as continuous [years] and dichotomous [70.2 yr as a cut-off] variables).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Significant (p{\textless}5E-08) associations (N=61) with tumour size, stage, grade, and age were identified in the GWAS discovery stage. None of the variants were independently significantly associated in the replication cohort. A meta-analysis of both cohorts suggests that rs180940944 (13q13.3 locus, NBEA) was associated with tumour size as a continuous variable (ß=0.9cm, p=2.92E-09). However, other single nucleotide polymorphisms in this region did not show evidence of association in the meta-analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that rs180940944 (NBEA) is associated with an increased NMIBC tumour size at the time of diagnosis. Given study limitations, further replication is essential to validate the finding.
PATIENT SUMMARY: The current study reports on a genome-wide association study on non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer tumour and patient characteristics. We suggest that NBEA gene might be associated with increased tumour size at the time of diagnosis. The result must be replicated to establish validity.},

	abstract = {Little is known whether genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies interact to increase bladder cancer risk. Recently, we identified two- and three-variant combinations associated with a particular increase of bladder cancer risk in a urinary bladder cancer case-control series (Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors at TU Dortmund (IfADo), 1501 cases, 1565 controls). In an independent case-control series (Nijmegen Bladder Cancer Study, NBCS, 1468 cases, 1720 controls) we confirmed these two- and three-variant combinations. Pooled analysis of the two studies as discovery group (IfADo-NBCS) resulted in sufficient statistical power to test up to four-variant combinations by a logistic regression approach. The New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies (2080 cases and 2167 controls) were used as a replication series. Twelve previously identified risk variants were considered. The strongest four-variant combination was obtained in never smokers. The combination of rs1014971[AA] near apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (APOBEC3A) and chromobox homolog 6 (CBX6), solute carrier family 1s4 (urea transporter), member 1 (Kidd blood group) (SLC14A1) exon single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1058396[AG, GG], UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A complex locus (UGT1A) intron SNP rs11892031[AA] and rs8102137[CC, CT] near cyclin E1 (CCNE1) resulted in an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.59 (95\% CI = 1.93-3.47; P = 1.87 × 10-10), while the individual variant ORs ranged only between 1.11 and 1.30. The combination replicated in the New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies (ORunadjusted = 1.60, 95\% CI = 1.10-2.33; P = 0.013). The four-variant combination is relatively frequent, with 25\% in never smoking cases and 11\% in never smoking controls (total study group: 19\% cases, 14\% controls). In conclusion, we show that four high-risk variants can statistically interact to confer increased bladder cancer risk particularly in never smokers.},

Therefore, we performed the first GWAS in a Chinese cohort comprising 3,406 cases of bladder cancer and 4,645 controls. We identified a new susceptibility locus for bladder cancer at 5q12.3, located in the intron of CWC27 (rs2042329), that was significantly associated with disease risk (OR = 1.40; P = 4.61 × 10(-11)). However, rs2042329 was not associated with bladder cancer risk in patients of European descent. The rs2042329 risk allele was also related to significantly increased expression levels of CWC27 mRNA and protein in bladder cancer tissues from Chinese patients. Additional functional analyses suggested that CWC27 played an oncogenic role in bladder cancer by inducing cell proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. In conclusion, the identification of a risk-associated locus at 5q12.3 provides new insights into the inherited susceptibility to bladder cancer in Chinese populations and may help to identify high-risk individuals.

In contrast, we detected two signals in the 20p12.2 region-the first signal is marked by rs6104690, and the second signal is marked by two moderately correlated SNPs (r(2) = 0.53), rs6108803 and the previously reported rs62185668. The second 20p12.2 signal is more strongly associated with the risk of muscle-invasive (T2-T4 stage) compared with non-muscle-invasive (Ta, T1 stage) bladder cancer (case-case P ≤ 0.02 for both rs62185668 and rs6108803). Functional analyses are needed to explore the biological mechanisms underlying these novel genetic associations with risk for bladder cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of related individuals have consistently demonstrated notable familial aggregation of cancer. We aim to estimate the heritability and genetic correlation attributable to the additive effects of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for cancer at 13 anatomical sites.
METHODS: Between 2007 and 2014, the US National Cancer Institute has generated data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 49 492 cancer case patients and 34 131 control patients. We apply novel mixed model methodology (GCTA) to this GWAS data to estimate the heritability of individual cancers, as well as the proportion of heritability attributable to cigarette smoking in smoking-related cancers, and the genetic correlation between pairs of cancers.
RESULTS: GWAS heritability was statistically significant at nearly all sites, with the estimates of array-based heritability, hl (2), on the liability threshold (LT) scale ranging from 0.05 to 0.38. Estimating the combined heritability of multiple smoking characteristics, we calculate that at least 24\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 14\% to 37\%) and 7\% (95\% CI = 4\% to 11\%) of the heritability for lung and bladder cancer, respectively, can be attributed to genetic determinants of smoking. Most pairs of cancers studied did not show evidence of strong genetic correlation. We found only four pairs of cancers with marginally statistically significant correlations, specifically kidney and testes (ρ = 0.73, SE = 0.28), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and pediatric osteosarcoma (ρ = 0.53, SE = 0.21), DLBCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (ρ = 0.51, SE =0.18), and bladder and lung (ρ = 0.35, SE = 0.14). Correlation analysis also indicates that the genetic architecture of lung cancer differs between a smoking population of European ancestry and a nonsmoking Asian population, allowing for the possibility that the genetic etiology for the same disease can vary by population and environmental exposures.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide important insights into the genetic architecture of cancers and suggest new avenues for investigation.},

	doi = {10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1531},
	abstract = {A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bladder cancer identified a genetic marker rs8102137 within the 19q12 region as a novel susceptibility variant. This marker is located upstream of the CCNE1 gene, which encodes cyclin E, a cell-cycle protein. We performed genetic fine-mapping analysis of the CCNE1 region using data from two bladder cancer GWAS (5,942 cases and 10,857 controls). We found that the original GWAS marker rs8102137 represents a group of 47 linked SNPs (with r(2) ≥ 0.7) associated with increased bladder cancer risk. From this group, we selected a functional promoter variant rs7257330, which showed strong allele-specific binding of nuclear proteins in several cell lines. In both GWASs, rs7257330 was associated only with aggressive bladder cancer, with a combined per-allele OR = 1.18 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.27, P = 4.67 × 10(-5)] versus OR = 1.01 (95\% CI, 0.93-1.10, P = 0.79) for nonaggressive disease, with P = 0.0015 for case-only analysis. Cyclin E protein expression analyzed in 265 bladder tumors was increased in aggressive tumors (P = 0.013) and, independently, with each rs7257330-A risk allele (P(trend) = 0.024). Overexpression of recombinant cyclin E in cell lines caused significant acceleration of cell cycle. In conclusion, we defined the 19q12 signal as the first GWAS signal specific for aggressive bladder cancer. Molecular mechanisms of this genetic association may be related to cyclin E overexpression and alteration of cell cycle in carriers of CCNE1 risk variants. In combination with established bladder cancer risk factors and other somatic and germline genetic markers, the CCNE1 variants could be useful for inclusion into bladder cancer risk prediction models.},

	abstract = {Through genome-wide association analysis and an independent replication study using a total of 1131 bladder cancer cases and 12 558 non-cancer controls of Japanese populations, we identified a susceptibility locus on chromosome 15q24. SNP rs11543198 was associated with bladder cancer risk with odds ratio (OR) of 1.41 and P-value of 4.03 × 10(-9). Subgroup analysis revealed rs11543198 to have a stronger effect in male smokers with OR of 1.66. SNP rs8041357, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 1) with rs11543198, was also associated with bladder cancer risk in Europeans (P = 0.045 for an additive and P = 0.025 for a recessive model), despite much lower minor allele frequency in Europeans (3.7\%) compared with the Japanese (22.2\%). Imputational analysis in this region suggested CYP1A2, which metabolizes tobacco-derived carcinogen, as a causative candidate gene. We also confirmed the association of previously reported loci, namely SLC14A1, APOBEC3A, PSCA and MYC, with bladder cancer.

	abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 14 genetic variants associated with bladder cancer in Caucasians. The effects of these risk variants and their cumulative effects in Asian populations are unknown. We genotyped these newly identified variants in a case-control study of 1,050 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer and 1,404 controls in the Chinese population. Odds rations (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed by logistic regression, and cumulative effect of risk alleles were evaluated. Overall, seven of the 14 variants were significantly associated with bladder cancer risk (p = 9.763 × 10(-3) for rs9642880 at 8q24.21, p = 3.004 × 10(-3) for rs2294008 at 8q24.3, p = 0.012 for rs798766 at 4p16.3, p = 0.034 for rs1495741 at 8p22, p = 2.306 × 10(-4) for GSTM1, p = 8.507 × 10(-8) for rs17674580 at 18q12.3, p = 7.179 × 10(-4) for rs10936599 at 3q26.2) and the odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.13 to 1.65. Moreover, there were a significant increased risk for bladder cancer positively correlated numbers of risk alleles and smoking status (Ptrend  = 7.060 × 10(-16) ). However, no allelic interaction effects on bladder cancer risk were observed between cumulative effects of variants and clinical characteristics. These findings suggest that seven bladder cancer risk-associated variants (rs9642880, rs2294008, rs798766, rs1495741, GSTM1 null, rs17674580 and rs10936599) may be used, collectively, to effectively measure inherited risk for bladder cancer.},

	abstract = {Three genome-wide association studies in Europe and the USA have reported eight urinary bladder cancer (UBC) susceptibility loci. Using extended case and control series and 1000 Genomes imputations of 5 340 737 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we searched for additional loci in the European GWAS. The discovery sample set consisted of 1631 cases and 3822 controls from the Netherlands and 603 cases and 37 781 controls from Iceland. For follow-up, we used 3790 cases and 7507 controls from 13 sample sets of European and Iranian ancestry. Based on the discovery analysis, we followed up signals in the urea transporter (UT) gene SLC14A. The strongest signal at this locus was represented by a SNP in intron 3, rs17674580, that reached genome-wide significance in the overall analysis of the discovery and follow-up groups: odds ratio = 1.17, P = 7.6 × 10(-11). SLC14A1 codes for UTs that define the Kidd blood group and are crucial for the maintenance of a constant urea concentration gradient in the renal medulla and, through this, the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. It is speculated that rs17674580, or other sequence variants in LD with it, indirectly modifies UBC risk by affecting urine production. If confirmed, this would support the 'urogenous contact hypothesis' that urine production and voiding frequency modify the risk of UBC.},

	abstract = {Few studies have demonstrated gene/environment interactions in cancer research. Using data on high-risk occupations for 2258 case patients and 2410 control patients from two bladder cancer studies, we observed that three of 16 known or candidate bladder cancer susceptibility variants displayed statistically significant and consistent evidence of additive interactions; specifically, the GSTM1 deletion polymorphism (Pinteraction ≤ .001), rs11892031 (UGT1A, Pinteraction = .01), and rs798766 (TMEM129-TACC3-FGFR3, Pinteraction = .03). There was limited evidence for multiplicative interactions. When we examined detailed data on a prevalent occupational exposure associated with increased bladder cancer risk, straight metalworking fluids, we also observed statistically significant additive interaction for rs798766 (TMEM129-TACC3-FGFR3, Pinteraction = .02), with the interaction more apparent in patients with tumors positive for FGFR3 expression. All statistical tests were two-sided. The interaction we observed for rs798766 (TMEM129-TACC3-FGFR3) with specific exposure to straight metalworking fluids illustrates the value of integrating germline genetic variation, environmental exposures, and tumor marker data to provide insight into the mechanisms of bladder carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Background: Ingestion of inorganic arsenic in drinking water is recognized as a cause of bladder cancer when levels are relatively high (≥ 150 µg/L). The epidemiologic evidence is less clear at the low-to-moderate concentrations typically observed in the United States. Accurate retrospective exposure assessment over a long time period is a major challenge in conducting epidemiologic studies of environmental factors and diseases with long latency, such as cancer.

Objective: We estimated arsenic concentrations in the water supplies of 2,611 participants in a population-based case–control study in northern New England.

Methods: Estimates covered the lifetimes of most study participants and were based on a combination of arsenic measurements at the homes of the participants and statistical modeling of arsenic concentrations in the water supply of both past and current homes. We assigned a residential water supply arsenic concentration for 165,138 (95\%) of the total 173,361 lifetime exposure years (EYs) and a workplace water supply arsenic level for 85,195 EYs (86\% of reported occupational years).

Results: Three methods accounted for 93\% of the residential estimates of arsenic concentration: direct measurement of water samples (27\%; median, 0.3 µg/L; range, 0.1–11.5), statistical models of water utility measurement data (49\%; median, 0.4 µg/L; range, 0.3–3.3), and statistical models of arsenic concentrations in wells using aquifers in New England (17\%; median, 1.6 µg/L; range, 0.6–22.4).

Conclusions: We used a different validation procedure for each of the three methods, and found our estimated levels to be comparable with available measured concentrations. This methodology allowed us to calculate potential drinking water exposure over long periods.},

Background: Incidence and mortality for BC has changed very little over the past 20 years. Approximately 40\% of patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive BC eventually recur/progress. It is important to understand the economic impact of disease recurrence/progression in BC. Methods: An economic model was constructed to calculate the number of patients receiving each treatment modality at every stage of disease and their respective costs. Epidemiological data was based on the CancerMPact Patient Metrics (PM) database, and treatment modality data retrieved from CMP Treatment Architecture (TA), 2021 version. Resource utilization and costs were obtained from the medical literature and public data sources. Only direct costs were considered. Results: There were an estimated 83,532 newly diagnosed BC patients of all stages in 2021 with a projected total cost of treatment of \$2,584,783,728. Average cost per patient varied from \$19,521 (stage 0a) to \$169,533 (metastatic disease) (Table). Cost profile differed substantially among the stages of disease. For the 75,760 patients that were expected to have a recurrence in 2021, an additional cost of \$3,953,096,316 was estimated at an average cost per patient of \$52,179. The expected total cost to treat newly diagnosed and newly recurrent patients is reported in this model, with the total cost in 2021 estimated to exceed \$6.5 billion. Conclusions: Treatment and resource costs increase for BC as the disease recurs/progresses. More effective treatments earlier in the disease setting to delay recurrence/progression may reduce the economic burden associated with BC.

	abstract = {Background:
Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is generally diagnosed early and may incur significant lifetime costs. This study estimated, from the payer’s perspective, the lifetime costs among patients diagnosed with UC according to stage at diagnosis.

Methods:
This retrospective analysis of the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database identified patients ≥66 years with newly diagnosed UC from 2004–2013. Patients were followed from UC diagnosis to death or last follow-up to estimate lifetime costs. Costs were allocated to 3 phases: diagnosis (≤3 months after diagnosis), terminal (≤3 months before death), and continuation (months between diagnosis and terminal phases). Survival-adjusted lifetime costs (total and major UC-related) were estimated for patients with UC based on stage at diagnosis (stages 0 through IV) and in a subgroup of patients receiving ≥1 systemic line of chemotherapy (LOC).

Results:
The sample included 15,588 patients: 3,446 stage 0 (8\% ≥1 LOC; median [IQR] follow-up in months: 44 [23–71]); 3,902 stage I (12\% ≥1 LOC; 33 [15–62]); 4,301 stage II (26\% ≥1 LOC; 17 [7–39]); 1,612 stage III (25\% ≥1 LOC; 17 [7–42]); and 2,327 stage IV (33\% ≥1 LOC; 8 [3–18]). Median age was 78 years and 72\% were male. Mean lifetime costs were lowest for stage IV patients (stage 0, \$151,626; stage 1, \$150,123; stage II, \$149,728; stage III, \$190,996; stage IV, \$117,503). Hospitalizations not involving a cystectomy contributed about half of lifetime costs across all stages. Cystectomy contributed 2–13\% of the total lifetime UC costs (\$3,356 stage 0; \$7,011 stage I; \$11,855 stage II; \$25,509 stage III; \$11,693 stage IV). UC-related office visits contributed 8–15\% of lifetime costs (\$11,717 stage 0; \$14,611 stage I; \$19,882 stage II; \$21,480 stage III; \$17,820 stage IV).

Conclusion:
UC continues to be a costly cancer with stage III patients having highest lifetime costs. Hospitalizations drive most of the lifetime costs across all stages; most of these hospitalizations did not involve costs related to cystectomy. Treatment plans requiring shorter and fewer hospitalizations may lessen the economic burden of UC.},

	abstract = {Bladder cancer is one of the most expensive malignant neoplasms to manage on a per-patient basis. Approximately 70\% of patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer present with non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a heterogeneous disease that leads to significant variability in the intensity of surveillance and treatments to decrease the risk of local recurrences and progression to more invasive disease. National guidelines advocate for risk-adapted surveillance and treatment in this patient population. High-risk NMIBC carries the highest risk of recurrence and progression. The financial costs associated with the treatment of high-risk NMIBC arise from frequent cystoscopic surveillance, adjunct testing (eg, urine cytology), periodic cross-sectional imaging, intravesical treatments (eg, bacillus Calmette-Guérin [BCG] therapy), transurethral resections of bladder tumor (TURBT) under general anesthesia, and definitive treatments for progression to muscle-invasive disease (eg, radical cystectomy). Recent publications quantifying the costs of care for this group with high-risk NMIBC have demonstrated that the most significant costs incurred are owing to disease progression and subsequent definitive treatments. Furthermore, the costs incurred by this patient population have been shown to lead to financial toxicity and adverse effects on quality of life. Adherence to guideline-directed care and the costs of treating high-risk NMIBC in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are less understood.},

Adequate induction BCG therapy was defined as at least 5 installations, and adequate maintenance BCG therapy was defined as at least 7 installations. Data were analyzed from January 2, 2020, to January 20, 2021.Intravesical BCG therapy, including adequate induction BCG therapy, was defined as at least 5 intravesical instillations of BCG within 70 days from BCG therapy start date. Adequate maintenance BCG therapy was defined as at least 7 installations of BCG within 274 days of the start (the first instillation) of adequate induction BCG therapy (ie, adequate induction BCG plus some form of additional BCG).The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate outcomes, including event-free survival. All-cause expenditures were summarized as medians with corresponding interquartile ranges (IQRs) and adjusted to 2019 USD.Of the 412 patients who met inclusion criteria, 335 (81\%) were male and 77 (19\%) were female, with a median age of 67 (IQR, 61-74) years. Follow-up was 2694 person-years. A total of 392 patients (95\%) received adequate induction BCG therapy, and 152 (37\%) received adequate BCG therapy. For all patients with high-risk NMIBC, the 10-year progression-free survival rate and disease-specific death rate were 78\% and 92\%, respectively. Patients with carcinoma in situ (Cis) had worse disease-free survival than those without Cis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.85; 95\% CI, 1.34-2.56). Total median costs at 1 year were \$29 459 (IQR, \$14 991-\$52 060); at 2 years, \$55 267 (IQR, \$28 667-\$99 846); and at 5 years, \$117 361 (IQR, \$59 680-\$211 298). Patients with progressive disease had significantly higher median 5-year costs (\$232 729 [IQR, \$151 321-\$341 195] vs \$94 879 [IQR, \$52 498-\$172 631]; P \&lt; .001), with outpatient care, pharmacy, and surgery-related costs contributing.Despite adequate induction BCG therapy, only 37\% of patients received adequate BCG therapy. Patients with Cis had increased risk of progression, and progression regardless of Cis was associated with significantly increased costs relative to patients without progression. Extrapolating cost figures, regardless of progression, resulted in nationwide costs at 1 year of \$373 million for patients diagnosed with high-risk NMIBC in 2019.},

To improve this, we provide four steps, template tables and examples. We distinguish two cases: when the causal effect of intervening on one exposure, across strata of another factor, is of interest (‘effect modification’); and when the causal effect of intervening on two exposures is of interest (‘interaction’). Assume we study whether X modifies the effect of A on D, where A, X and D are dichotomous. We propose presenting: (i) relative risks (RRs), odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) for each (A, X) stratum with a single reference category taken as the stratum with the lowest risk of D; (ii) RRs, ORs or RDs for A within strata of X; (iii) interaction measures on additive and multiplicative scales; (iv) the A–D confounders adjusted for.Assume we study the interaction between A and B on D, where A, B and D are dichotomous. Steps (i) and (iii) are similar to presenting effect modification. (ii) Present RRs, ORs or RDs for A within strata of B and for B within strata of A. (iv) List the A–D and B–D confounders adjusted for.These four pieces of information will provide a reader the information needed to assess effect modification or interaction. The presentation can be further enriched when exposures have multiple categories.

	abstract = {Each year, 430,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer. Due to the high recurrence rate of the disease, primary prevention is paramount. Therefore, we reviewed all meta-analyses on modifiable risk factors of primary bladder cancer. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane database were systematically searched for meta-analyses on modifiable risk factors published between 1995 and 2015. When appropriate, meta-analyses (MA) were combined in meta–meta-analysis (MMA). If not, the most comprehensive MA was selected based on the number of primary studies included. Probability of causation was calculated for individual factors and a subset of lifestyle factors combined. Of 1496 articles identified, 5 were combined in MMA and 21 were most comprehensive on a single risk factor. Statistically significant associations were found for current (RR 3.14) or former (RR 1.83) cigarette smoking, pipe (RR 1.9) or cigar (RR 2.3) smoking, antioxidant supplementation (RR 1.52), obesity (RR 1.10), higher physical activity levels (RR 0.86), higher body levels of selenium (RR 0.61) and vitamin D (RR 0.75), and higher intakes of: processed meat (RR 1.22), vitamin A (RR 0.82), vitamin E (RR 0.82), folate (RR 0.84), fruit (RR 0.77), vegetables (RR 0.83), citrus fruit (RR 0.85), and cruciferous vegetables (RR 0.84). Finally, three occupations with the highest risk were tobacco workers (RR 1.72), dye workers (RR 1.58), and chimney sweeps (RR 1.53). The probability of causation for individual factors ranged from 4 to 68 \%. The combined probability of causation was 81.8 \%. Modification of lifestyle and occupational exposures can considerably reduce the bladder cancer burden. While smoking remains one of the key risk factors, also several diet-related and occupational factors are very relevant.},

	abstract = {Populations exposed to arsenic in drinking water have an increased bladder cancer risk and evidence suggests that several factors may modify arsenic metabolism, influencing disease risk. We evaluated whether the association between cumulative lifetime arsenic exposure from drinking water and bladder cancer risk was modified by factors that may impact arsenic metabolism in a population-based case-control study of 1,213 cases and 1,418 controls. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between cumulative arsenic intake and bladder cancer stratified by age, sex, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, and folate intake. P-values for interaction were computed using a likelihood ratio test. We observed no statistically significant multiplicative interactions although some variations in associations were notable across risk factors, particularly for smoking and BMI. Among former smokers and current smokers, those with the highest cumulative arsenic intake had elevated risks of bladder cancer (OR=1.4, 95\%CI:0.96–2.0 and OR=1.6, 95\% CI:0.91–3.0, respectively; while the OR among never smokers was 1.1, 95\%CI:0.6–1.9, p-interaction=0.49). Among those classified as normal or overweight based on usual adult BMI, the highest level of cumulative arsenic intake was associated with elevated risks of bladder cancer (OR=1.3, 95\%CI:0.89–2.0 and OR=1.6, 95\% CI:1.1–2.4, respectively), while risk was not elevated among those who were obese (OR=0.9, 95\%CI: 0.4–1.8) (p-interaction=0.14). Our study provides some limited evidence of modifying roles of age, sex, smoking, BMI, folate, and alcohol on arsenic-related bladder cancer risk that requires confirmation in other, larger studies.},

	abstract = {Bladder cancer results from the combined effects of environmental and genetic factors, smoking being the strongest risk factor. Evaluating absolute risks resulting from the joint effects of smoking and genetic factors is critical to assess the public health relevance of genetic information. Analyses included up to 3,942 cases and 5,680 controls of European background in seven studies. We tested for multiplicative and additive interactions between smoking and 12 susceptibility loci, individually and combined as a polygenic risk score (PRS). Thirty-year absolute risks and risk differences by levels of the PRS were estimated for U.S. males aged 50 years. Six of 12 variants showed significant additive gene-environment interactions, most notably NAT2 (P = 7 × 10(-4)) and UGT1A6 (P = 8 × 10(-4)). The 30-year absolute risk of bladder cancer in U.S. males was 6.2\% for all current smokers. This risk ranged from 2.9\% for current smokers in the lowest quartile of the PRS to 9.9\% for current smokers in the upper quartile. Risk difference estimates indicated that 8,200 cases would be prevented if elimination of smoking occurred in 100,000 men in the upper PRS quartile compared with 2,000 cases prevented by a similar effort in the lowest PRS quartile (P(additive) = 1 × 10(-4)). Thus, the potential impact of eliminating smoking on the number of bladder cancer cases prevented is larger for individuals at higher than lower genetic risk. Our findings could have implications for targeted prevention strategies. However, other smoking-related diseases, as well as practical and ethical considerations, need to be considered before any recommendations could be made.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We examined the interaction between common genetic bladder cancer variants, diet quality, and bladder cancer risk in a population-based case-control study conducted in New England.
METHODS: At the time of enrollment, 806 bladder cancer cases and 974 controls provided a DNA sample and completed a diet history questionnaire. Diet quality was assessed using the 2010 Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) score. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in genome-wide association studies to be associated with bladder cancer risk were combined into a polygenic risk score and also examined individually for interaction with the AHEI-2010. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: A 1-standard deviation increase in polygenic risk score was associated with higher bladder cancer risk (OR, 1.34; 95\% CI 1.21-1.49). Adherence to the AHEI-2010 was not associated with bladder cancer risk (OR, 0.99; 95\% CI 0.98-1.00) and the polygenic risk score did not appear to modify the association between the AHEI-2010 and bladder cancer risk. In single-SNP analyses, rs8102137 (bladder cancer risk allele, C) modified the association between the AHEI-2010 total score and bladder cancer risk, with the strongest evidence for the AHEI-2010 long chain fat guideline (OR for TT, 0.92; 95\% CI 0.87-0.98; OR for CT, 1.02; 95\% CI 0.96-1.08; OR for CC, 1.03; 95\% CI 0.93-1.14; p for interaction, 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, rs8102137 near the cyclin E1 gene ( CCNE1 ) may be involved in gene-diet interactions for bladder cancer risk.},

To examine the effects of lower levels of arsenic exposure on bladder cancer incidence, we conducted a case-control study in New Hampshire, USA where levels above 10 micro/l are commonly found in private wells.
METHODS: We studied 383 cases of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder cancer, newly diagnosed between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1998 and 641 general population controls. Individual exposure to arsenic was determined in toenail clippings using instrumental neutron activation analysis.
RESULTS: Among smokers, an elevated odds ratio (OR) for bladder cancer was observed for the uppermost category of arsenic (OR: 2.17, 95\% CI: 0.92-5.11 for greater than 0.330 mcg/g compared to less than 0.06 micro/g). Among never smokers, there was no association between arsenic and bladder cancer risk.
CONCLUSIONS: These, and other data, suggest that ingestion of low to moderate arsenic levels may affect bladder cancer incidence, and that cigarette smoking may act as a co-carcinogen.},

Quality control (QC) procedures for GWAS are computationally intensive, operationally challenging, and constantly evolving. With each new dataset, new realities are discovered about GWAS data and best practices continue to be developed. The Genomics Workgroup of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) funded electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network has invested considerable effort in developing strategies for QC of these data. The lessons learned by this group will be valuable for other investigators dealing with large scale genomic datasets. Here we enumerate some of the challenges in QC of GWAS data and describe the approaches that the eMERGE network is using for quality assurance in GWAS data, thereby minimizing potential bias and error in GWAS results. In this protocol we discuss common issues associated with QC of GWAS data, including data file formats, software packages for data manipulation and analysis, sex chromosome anomalies, sample identity, sample relatedness, population substructure, batch effects, and marker quality.

	abstract = {Introduction The current study determined the level and trends associated with the incidence, death and disability rates for bladder cancer and its attributable risk factors in 204 countries and territories, from 1990 to 2019, by age, sex and sociodemographic index (SDI; a composite measure of sociodemographic factors).
Methods Various data sources from different countries, including vital registration and cancer registries were used to generate estimates. Mortality data and incidence data transformed to mortality estimates using the mortality to incidence ratio (MIR) were used in a cause of death ensemble model to estimate mortality. Mortality estimates were divided by the MIR to produce incidence estimates. Prevalence was calculated using incidence and MIR-based survival estimates. Age-specific mortality and standardised life expectancy were used to estimate years of life lost (YLLs). Prevalence was multiplied by disability weights to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs), while disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are the sum of the YLLs and YLDs. All estimates were presented as counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 population.
Results Globally, there were 524 000 bladder cancer incident cases (95\% uncertainty interval 476 000 to 569 000) and 229 000 bladder cancer deaths (211 000 to 243 000) in 2019. Age-standardised death rate decreased by 15.7\% (8.6 to 21.0), during the period 1990–2019. Bladder cancer accounted for 4.39 million (4.09 to 4.70) DALYs in 2019, and the age-standardised DALY rate decreased significantly by 18.6\% (11.2 to 24.3) during the period 1990–2019. In 2019, Monaco had the highest age-standardised incidence rate (31.9 cases (23.3 to 56.9) per 100 000), while Lebanon had the highest age-standardised death rate (10.4 (8.1 to 13.7)). Cabo Verde had the highest increase in age-standardised incidence (284.2\% (214.1 to 362.8)) and death rates (190.3\% (139.3 to 251.1)) between 1990 and 2019. In 2019, the global age-standardised incidence and death rates were higher among males than females, across all age groups and peaked in the 95+ age group. Globally, 36.8\% (28.5 to 44.0) of bladder cancer DALYs were attributable to smoking, more so in males than females (43.7\% (34.0 to 51.8) vs 15.2\% (10.9 to 19.4)). In addition, 9.1\% (1.9 to 19.6) of the DALYs were attributable to elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (males 9.3\% (1.6 to 20.9); females 8.4\% (1.6 to 19.1)).
Conclusions There was considerable variation in the burden of bladder cancer between countries during the period 1990–2019. Although there was a clear global decrease in the age-standardised death, and DALY rates, some countries experienced an increase in these rates. National policy makers should learn from these differences, and allocate resources for preventative measures, based on their country-specific estimates. In addition, smoking and elevated FPG play an important role in the burden of bladder cancer and need to be addressed with prevention programmes.},

	abstract = {Background
Previous studies have indicated association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms and bladder cancer susceptibility, but the results have been inconclusive. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between GSTM1/GSTT1 deletion polymorphisms and bladder cancer susceptibility.

Methods
We searched for all studies investigating the association between GSTM1 or GSTT1 polymorphism and bladder cancer susceptibility in Pubmed, Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Central Search Library. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Subgroup analyses were performed on different ethnicity, population-based and smoking status.

Results
Our search identified 63 studies. GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null and GSTM1/GSTT1 double-null genotypes were associated with increased risk of bladder cancer (OR: 1.36 95\% CI: 1.25-1.47, P{\textless}0.01; OR: 1.13 95\% CI: 1.02-1.25, P{\textless}0.01; OR: 1.84 95\% CI: 1.50-2.26, P{\textless}0.01). Subgroup analyses indicated that the GSTM1-null genotype was associated with increased risk of bladder cancer in Caucasians and Asians, while the GSTT1-null genotype was associated with increased risk of bladder cancer in Caucasians. The GSTM1/GSTT1 double-null genotype was associated with increased risk of bladder cancer in Caucasians, Asians, and Africans. Stratified analyses of population-based associations indicated increased bladder cancer risk associated with GSTM1-null and GSTM1/GSTT1 double-null genotypes in hospital-based and population-based studies. GSTM1 deletion was associated with increased bladder cancer risk in both smokers and nonsmokers. Non-smokers with the GSTM1/GSTT1 double-null genotype had an increased bladder cancer risk.

Conclusion
This meta-analysis demonstrates that the GSTM1-null, GSTT1-null, and GSTM1/GSTT1 double-null genotypes are associated with increased bladder cancer risk.},

	abstract = {Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for bladder cancer. The effects of smoking duration, intensity (cigarettes per day), and total exposure (pack-years); smoking cessation; exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; and changes in the composition of tobacco and cigarette design over time on risk of bladder cancer are unclear.We examined bladder cancer risk in relation to smoking practices based on interview data from a large, population-based case–control study conducted in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont from 2001 to 2004 (N = 1170 urothelial carcinoma case patients and 1413 control subjects). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional logistic regression. To examine changes in smoking-induced bladder cancer risk over time, we compared odds ratios from New Hampshire residents in this study (305 case patients and 335 control subjects) with those from two case–control studies conducted in New Hampshire in 1994–1998 and in 1998–2001 (843 case patients and 1183 control subjects). Regular and current cigarette smokers had higher risks of bladder cancer than never-smokers (for regular smokers, OR = 3.0, 95\% CI = 2.4 to 3.6; for current smokers, OR = 5.2, 95\% CI = 4.0 to 6.6). In New Hampshire, there was a statistically significant increasing trend in smoking-related bladder cancer risk over three consecutive periods (1994–1998, 1998–2001, and 2002–2004) among former smokers (OR = 1.4, 95\% CI = 1.0 to 2.0; OR = 2.0, 95\% CI = 1.4 to 2.9; and OR = 2.6, 95\% CI = 1.7 to 4.0, respectively) and current smokers (OR = 2.9, 95\% CI = 2.0 to 4.2; OR = 4.2, 95\% CI = 2.8 to 6.3; OR = 5.5, 95\% CI = 3.5 to 8.9, respectively) ( P for homogeneity of trends over time periods = .04). We also observed that within categories of intensity, odds ratios increased approximately linearly with increasing pack-years smoked, but the slope of the increasing trend declined with increasing intensity. Smoking-related risks of bladder cancer appear to have increased in New Hampshire since the mid-1990s. Based on our modeling of pack-years and intensity, smoking fewer cigarettes over a long time appears more harmful than smoking more cigarettes over a shorter time, for equal total pack-years of cigarettes smoked.},

	abstract = {Arsenic contamination of drinking water is a major public health issue in many countries, increasing risk for a wide array of diseases, including cancer. There is inter-individual variation in arsenic metabolism efficiency and susceptibility to arsenic toxicity; however, the basis of this variation is not well understood. Here, we have performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of arsenic-related metabolism and toxicity phenotypes to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which arsenic affects health. Using data on urinary arsenic metabolite concentrations and approximately 300,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 1,313 arsenic-exposed Bangladeshi individuals, we identified genome-wide significant association signals (P{\textless}5×10(-8)) for percentages of both monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) near the AS3MT gene (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32), with five genetic variants showing independent associations. In a follow-up analysis of 1,085 individuals with arsenic-induced premalignant skin lesions (the classical sign of arsenic toxicity) and 1,794 controls, we show that one of these five variants (rs9527) is also associated with skin lesion risk (P = 0.0005). Using a subset of individuals with prospectively measured arsenic (n = 769), we show that rs9527 interacts with arsenic to influence incident skin lesion risk (P = 0.01). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses of genome-wide expression data from 950 individual's lymphocyte RNA suggest that several of our lead SNPs represent cis-eQTLs for AS3MT (P = 10(-12)) and neighboring gene C10orf32 (P = 10(-44)), which are involved in C10orf32-AS3MT read-through transcription. This is the largest and most comprehensive genomic investigation of arsenic metabolism and toxicity to date, the only GWAS of any arsenic-related trait, and the first study to implicate 10q24.32 variants in both arsenic metabolism and arsenical skin lesion risk. The observed patterns of associations suggest that MMA\% and DMA\% have distinct genetic determinants and support the hypothesis that DMA is the less toxic of these two methylated arsenic species. These results have potential translational implications for the prevention and treatment of arsenic-associated toxicities worldwide.},

Recently, inverse normal transformations (INTs) have gained popularity among genetics researchers and are implemented as an option in several software packages. Despite this increasing use, we are unaware of extensive simulations or mathematical proofs showing that INTs have desirable statistical properties in the context of genetic studies. We show that INTs do not necessarily maintain proper Type 1 error control and can also reduce statistical power in some circumstances. Many alternatives to INTs exist. Therefore, we contend that there is a lack of justification for performing parametric statistical procedures on INTs with the exceptions of simple designs with moderate to large sample sizes, which makes permutation testing computationally infeasible and where maximum likelihood testing is used. Rigorous research evaluating the utility of INTs seems warranted.},

	abstract = {Subjects exposed to arsenic show significant inter-individual variation in urinary patterns of arsenic metabolites but insignificant day-to-day intra-individual variation. The inter-individual variation in arsenic methylation can be partly responsible for the variation in susceptibility to arsenic toxicity. Wide inter-ethnic variation and family correlation in urinary arsenic profile suggest a genetic effect on arsenic metabolism. In this paper the environmental factors affecting arsenic metabolism are reviewed. Methylation capacity might reduce with increasing dosage of arsenic exposure. Furthermore, women, especially at pregnancy, have better methylation capacity than their men counterparts, probably due to the effect of estrogen. Children might have better methylation capacity than adults and age shows inconsistent relevance in adults. Smoking and alcohol consumption might be associated with a poorer methylation capacity. Nutritional status is important in the methylation capacity and folate may facilitate the methylation and excretion of arsenic. Besides, general health conditions and medications might influence the arsenic methylation capacity; and technical problems can cause biased estimates. The consumption of seafood, seaweed, rice and other food with high arsenic contents and the extent of cooking and arsenic-containing water used in food preparation may also interfere with the presentation of the urinary arsenic profile. Future studies are necessary to clarify the effects of the various arsenic metabolites including the trivalent methylated forms on the development of arsenic-induced human diseases with the consideration of the effects of confounding factors and the interactions with other effect modifiers.},

          Behavioral effects of prenatal exposure to mixtures of essential and toxic metals are incompletely understood.
          Methods: 
          We investigated neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal metal exposures in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, a prospective birth cohort. We measured metals (As, Cu, Mn, Pb, Se, Zn) in maternal prenatal and postnatal toenails and infant toenails, reflecting exposures during periconception and early pregnancy, mid pregnancy, and late pregnancy and early neonatal life, respectively. Mothers completed the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd ed. (SRS-2) and the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd ed. (BASC-2) to assess their child’s neurobehavior at 3 years. We used mean field variational Bayes for lagged kernel machine regression to investigate associations of toenail metal concentrations with SRS-2 Total Scores and BASC-2 composite scores (SRS-2: n = 371; BASC-2: n = 318).
          Results: 
          Infant toenail Mn was associated with poorer performance on multiple BASC-2 composite scores. Maternal postnatal toenail As was associated with worse scores on the BASC-2 Internalizing Problems and Behavioral Symptoms Index. Associations with Mn were generally stronger in males, and associations with As were generally stronger in females. Other metals, including Pb, were weakly or inconsistently associated with BASC-2 outcomes, and there were no strong associations of individual metals and SRS-2 Total Scores. We observed suggestive evidence of interaction between As and Se for SRS-2 Total Scores and BASC-2 Adaptive Skills, though overall evidence of interactions between metals was weak.
          Conclusion: 
          Our results support the hypothesis that exposure to Mn and As in mid to late pregnancy may be neurodevelopmentally harmful.},

	abstract = {Quantitative measurements of environmental factors greatly improve the quality of epidemiologic studies but can pose challenges because of the presence of upper or lower detection limits or interfering compounds, which do not allow for precise measured values. We consider the regression of an environmental measurement (dependent variable) on several covariates (independent variables). Various strategies are commonly employed to impute values for interval-measured data, including assignment of one-half the detection limit to nondetected values or of “fill-in” values randomly selected from an appropriate distribution. On the basis of a limited simulation study, we found that the former approach can be biased unless the percentage of measurements below detection limits is small (5–10\%). The fill-in approach generally produces unbiased parameter estimates but may produce biased variance estimates and thereby distort inference when 30\% or more of the data are below detection limits. Truncated data methods (e.g., Tobit regression) and multiple imputation offer two unbiased approaches for analyzing measurement data with detection limits. If interest resides solely on regression parameters, then Tobit regression can be used. If individualized values for measurements below detection limits are needed for additional analysis, such as relative risk regression or graphical display, then multiple imputation produces unbiased estimates and nominal confidence intervals unless the proportion of missing data is extreme. We illustrate various approaches using measurements of pesticide residues in carpet dust in control subjects from a case–control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.},

Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression assigns the joint mixture effect weights to indicate the overall association of multiple exposures, and quantile-based g-computation is a generalized version of WQS without the restriction of directional homogeneity. This paper proposes an adaptive-mixture-categorization (AMC)-based g-computation approach that combines g-computation with an optimal exposure categorization search using the F statistic. AMC-based g-computation reduces variance within each category and retains the variance between categories to build more powerful predictors. In a simulation study, the performance of association analysis was improved using categorizing by AMC compared with quantiles. We applied this method to assess the association between a mixture of 12 trace element concentrations measured from toenails and the risk of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Our findings suggested that medium-level (116.7–145.5 μg/g) vs. low-level (39.5–116.2 μg/g) of toenail zinc had a statistically significant positive association with bladder cancer risk.},

	abstract = {The aim was to assess how urinary creatinine is affected by age, gender, body size and meat intake, and to determine to what extent such factors might affect the creatinine adjustment of urinary cadmium. The study was based on three Swedish studies: (1) 67 non-smoking women aged 20-50 years (24-h urine samples); (2) 289 men and 434 women aged 16-81 years (spot urine samples); and (3) 98 men and 105 women aged 19-72 years (spot urine samples). The effects of age, body surface area (as an indicator of muscle mass), and meat intake on urinary creatinine and cadmium were analysed using multiple regression analyses. Gender- and age-related variations in urinary creatinine and cadmium adjusted for creatinine or specific gravity were compared by ANOVA or ANCOVA. In the multiple regression analyses, body surface area, gender, age and meat intake were the major determinants of urinary creatinine. Urinary cadmium adjusted for creatinine and specific gravity were also dependent on body size, gender and age. Urinary cadmium adjusted for creatinine was 15-92\% higher in women or older individuals than in men or younger individuals. Women or older individuals had -3 to 79\% higher urinary cadmium adjusted for specific gravity than men or younger individuals had, and such a difference between gender or age group was less obvious in specific gravity adjustment than in creatinine adjustment. Thus, urinary cadmium adjusted for creatinine is more affected by age, gender, body size and meat intake than is specific gravity adjustment. When comparing individuals or populations with large differences in muscle mass or meat intake, such effects can be especially important. In such studies, specific gravity adjustment seems to be more appropriate.},

	abstract = {Background To determine the presence of interaction in epidemiologic research, typically a product term is added to the regression model. In linear regression, the regression coefficient of the product term reflects interaction as departure from additivity. However, in logistic regression it refers to interaction as departure from multiplicativity. Rothman has argued that interaction estimated as departure from additivity better reflects biologic interaction. So far, literature on estimating interaction on an additive scale using logistic regression only focused on dichotomous determinants. The objective of the present study was to provide the methods to estimate interaction between continuous determinants and to illustrate these methods with a clinical example.Methods and results From the existing literature we derived the formulas to quantify interaction as departure from additivity between one continuous and one dichotomous determinant and between two continuous determinants using logistic regression. Bootstrapping was used to calculate the corresponding confidence intervals. To illustrate the theory with an empirical example, data from the Utrecht Health Project were used, with age and body mass index as risk factors for elevated diastolic blood pressure.Conclusions The methods and formulas presented in this article are intended to assist epidemiologists to calculate interaction on an additive scale between two variables on a certain outcome.

Limited evidence suggests that the ability to fully metabolize arsenic into DMA influences susceptibility to disease. To determine whether percentage of MMA was predictive of disease, the authors used data from a case-control study conducted in Bangladesh (2001–2003). Persons who were diagnosed with keratosis, melanosis, Bowen's disease, or squamous cell carcinoma were matched on age, sex, and village to persons without these conditions. This analysis was restricted to persons who had no missing data on covariates (859 cases, 868 controls). A path analysis was used to evaluate simultaneously the association between the percentage of all urinary arsenic metabolites and the odds of skin lesions using PROC CALIS in SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and Mplus, version 6.1 (Muthén \& Muthén, Los Angeles, California). The odds of skin lesions were significantly associated with log10 percentage of MMA (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) = 1.56, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.15, 2.12) but not log10 percentage of inorganic arsenic (ORadj = 1.06, 95\% CI: 0.75, 1.50) or log10 percentage of DMA (ORadj = 1.07, 95\% CI: 0.33, 3.46). This novel analysis confirmed that persons who excrete a higher proportion of MMA have a greater risk of skin lesions after data are adequately controlled for urinary arsenic metabolites, current arsenic exposure, and other risk factors.},

	abstract = {Background:
Millions of people worldwide are exposed to arsenic in drinking water, and many are likely coexposed to other agents that could substantially increase their risks of arsenic-related cancer.

Methods:
We performed a case-control study of multiple chemical exposures in 538 lung and bladder cancer cases and 640 controls in northern Chile, an area with formerly high drinking water arsenic concentrations. Detailed information was collected on lifetime arsenic exposure, smoking, secondhand smoke, and other known or suspected carcinogens, including asbestos, silica, and wood dust.

Results:
Very high lung and bladder cancer odds ratios (ORs), and evidence of greater than additive effects, were seen in people exposed to arsenic concentrations {\textgreater}335 μg/L and who were tobacco smokers (OR = 16, 95\% confidence interval = 6.5–40 for lung cancer; and OR = 23 [8.2–66] for bladder cancer; Rothman Synergy Indices = 4.0 [1.7–9.4] and 2.0 [0.92–4.5], respectively). Evidence of greater than additive effects were also seen in people coexposed to arsenic and secondhand tobacco smoke and several other known or suspected carcinogens, including asbestos, silica, and wood dust.

Conclusions:
These findings suggest that people coexposed to arsenic and other known or suspected carcinogens have very high risks of lung or bladder cancer.},

	issn = {2211-3436},
	doi = {10.1007/s13402-018-0393-5},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the identification of a bladder cancer susceptibility variant (rs710521) in a non-coding intergenic region between the TP63 and LEPREL1 genes on chromosome 3q28, suggesting a role in the transcriptional regulation of these genes. In this study, we aimed to functionally characterize the 3q28 bladder cancer risk locus.
METHODS: Fine-mapping was performed by focusing on the region surrounding rs710521, and variants were prioritized for further experiments using ENCODE regulatory data. The enhancer activity of the identified region was evaluated using dual-luciferase assays. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the enhancer region was performed and the effect of this deletion on cell proliferation and gene expression levels was evaluated using CellTiter-Glo and RT-qPCR, respectively.
RESULTS: Fine-mapping of the GWAS signal region led to the identification of twenty SNPs that showed a stronger association with bladder cancer risk than rs710521. Using publicly available data on regulatory elements and sequences, an enhancer region containing the bladder cancer risk variants was identified. Through reporter assays, we found that the presence of the enhancer region significantly increased ΔNTP63 promoter activity in bladder cancer-derived cell lines. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the enhancer region reduced the viability of bladder cancer cells by decreasing the expression of ΔNTP63 and p63 target genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data show that bladder cancer risk-associated variants on chromosome 3q28 are located in an active enhancer region. Further characterization of the allele-specific activity of the identified enhancer and its target genes may lead to the identification of novel signaling pathways involved in bladder carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have confirmed association of TP63C/T rs710521, TERTC/T rs2736098, and SLC14A1C/T rs17674580 gene variants with susceptibility to bladder cancer (BC) in European and White population. However, the risk conferred for BC for above gene variants in North Indians is unknown. We therefore, studied the association of TP63C/T, TERTC/T, and SLC14A1C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a risk of BC susceptibility in North Indian cohort.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In histologically confirmed 225 BC cases and 240 healthy controls, 3 SNPs were genotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction. To evaluate the SNP effects on BC susceptibility, odds ratio (OR) and CI 95\% were calculated.
RESULTS: In case of TP63C/T, the variant genotype (TT) showed significant reduced risk for BC (P = 0.045, OR = 0.53). Combining heterozygous and variant genotypes also demonstrated reduced risk for BC (P{\textless} 0.001, OR = 0.54). In case of TERTC/T, heterozygous genotype (CT) as well as variant genotype (TT) showed significant risk for BC susceptibility (P = 0.031, OR = 1.77 and P = 0.004, OR = 2.78, respectively) along with T allelic level (P{\textless}0.001, OR = 4.19). Furthermore, in case of SLC14A1C/T gene polymorphism, the variant genotype (TT) showed significant high risk for BC susceptibility (P = 0.006; OR = 3.01) along with variant T allelic level (P = 0.003, OR = 1.52). Interestingly, smoking was also found to modulate risks for BC in case of TERT and SLC14A1 variant genotype (TT). Further clinical confounding factor, namely, tumor grade/stage level of cases, supports the genotypic data with TERT and SLC14A1 showing a risk for BC susceptibility.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that polymorphism in TERTC/T and SLC14A1C/T confirmed high risk for BC in North Indian population. However, TP63C/T showed reduced risk of BC susceptibility. More replicate studies with large sample size and diverse ethnicity are required to validate these observations.},

However, in a case-control series of patients that have been occupationally exposed to aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, rs9642880[T] was not influential but GSTM1 0/0 was significantly associated with bladder cancer risk.

	abstract = {Background
Multiple chromosome 8q24 genotypic variants are strongly implicated in several cancers. Recent genome-wide association studies of urinary bladder cancer report risk to be associated with the T allele of rs9642880 on 8q24 among individuals of European descent.

Methods
We examined associations between bladder cancer risk and genotypes defined by rs9642880 and each of 8 additional 8q24 variants associated with risk of other cancers, in both high-risk non-Hispanic white and low-risk Chinese participants enrolled in a large population-based case–control study conducted in Los Angeles County and Shanghai.

Results
We confirmed association of rs9642880 T with bladder cancer risk not only among non-Hispanic whites but also among Chinese participants [overall per-allele relative risk estimate 1.32 (95\% CI, 1.16–1.50; P = 0.000024)]. Subgroup analyses suggested that effects of rs9642880 are largely confined to nonsmokers and former smokers, and may be particularly important in the etiology of noninvasive papillary tumors. There was little indication that 8q24 SNPs associated with other cancer types—rs7008482, rs7000448, rs6983561, rs6983267, rs13281615, rs13254738, or rs10090154—are associated with bladder cancer risk.

Conclusions
Bladder cancer risk is associated specifically with variation in the discrete 8q24 region containing rs9642880. Factors other than rs9642880 genotypes seem to underlie differences in bladder cancer risk between non-Hispanic whites and Chinese.

Impact
Characterization of functional consequences of genetic variation in the discrete region including rs9642880 is needed to understand biological basis of this bladder cancer-specific 8q24 association in these racial/ethnic groups characterized by both high and low risk of bladder cancer.},

	abstract = {Humans living in the Andes Mountains have been historically exposed to arsenic from natural sources, including drinking water. Enzymatic methylation of arsenic allows it to be excreted more efficiently by the human body. Adaptation to high-arsenic environments via enhanced methylation and excretion of arsenic was first reported in indigenous women in the Argentinean Andes, but whether adaptation to arsenic is a general phenomenon across native populations from the Andes Mountains remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated whether adaptation to arsenic has occurred in the Bolivian Andes by studying indigenous groups who belong to the Aymara-Quechua and Uru ethnicities and have lived in the Bolivian Andes for generations. Our population genetics methods, including genome-wide selection scans based on linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequency differences, in combination with targeted and whole-genome sequencing and genotype–phenotype association analyses, detected signatures of positive selection near the gene encoding arsenite methyltransferase (AS3MT), the main arsenic methylating enzyme. This was among the strongest selection signals (top 0.5\% signals via locus-specific branch length and extended haplotype homozygosity tests) at a genome-wide level in the Bolivian study groups. We found a large haplotype block of 676 kb in the AS3MT region and identified candidate functional variants for further analysis. Moreover, our analyses revealed associations between AS3MT variants and the fraction of mono-methylated arsenic in urine and showed that the Bolivian study groups had the highest frequency of alleles associated with more efficient arsenic metabolism reported so far. Our data support the idea that arsenic exposure has been a driver for human adaptation to tolerate arsenic through more efficient arsenic detoxification in different Andean populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of a microRNA (miRNA) expression signature of bladder cancer (BC) by deep-sequencing revealed that clustered miRNAs microRNA (miR)-451a, miR-144-3p, and miR-144-5p were significantly downregulated in BC tissues. We hypothesised that these miRNAs function as tumour suppressors in BC. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional roles of these miRNAs and their modulation of cancer networks in BC cells.
METHODS: The functional studies of BC cells were performed using transfection of mature miRNAs. Genome-wide gene expression analysis, in silico analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were applied to identify miRNA targets. The association between miR-144-5p levels and expression of the target genes was determined, and overall patient survival as a function of target gene expression was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Gain-of-function studies showed that miR-144-5p significantly inhibited cell proliferation by BC cells. Four cell cycle-related genes (CCNE1, CCNE2, CDC25A, and PKMYT1) were identified as direct targets of miR-144-5p. The patients with high CCNE1 or CCNE2 expression had lower overall survival probabilities than those with low expression (P=0.025 and P=0.032).
CONCLUSION: miR-144-5p functions as tumour suppressor in BC cells. CCNE1 and CCNE2 were directly regulated by miR-144-5p and might be good prognostic markers for survival of BC patients.},

Cancer susceptibility candidate 11 (CASC11) is a prominent lncRNA that is upregulated in various types of cancers. Moreover, its overexpression correlates with larger tumor size, more advanced cancer stages, cancer metastasis, and poor overall survival for most types of cancer. Functionally, the knockdown of CASC11 can inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, while enhancing apoptosis through its regulation of gene expression and signaling pathways and its interactions with functional proteins.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic studies previously reported that variants in TERT-CLPTM1L genes were related to susceptibility of cancer and non-cancer diseases. However, conclusions were not always concordant.
METHODS: We performed meta-analyses to assess correlations between 23 variants within TERT-CLPTM1L region and susceptibility to 12 cancers and 1 non-cancer disease based on data in 109 papers (involving 139,510 cases and 208,530 controls). Two approaches (false-positive report probability test and Venice criteria) were adopted for assessing the cumulative evidence of significant associations. Current study evaluated the potential role of these variants based on data in Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project.
RESULTS: Thirteen variants were statistically associated with susceptibility to 11 cancers and 1 non-cancer disease (p {\textless} 0.05). Besides, 12 variants with eight cancers and one non-cancer disease were rated as strong evidence (rs2736098, rs401681, and rs402710 in bladder cancer; rs2736100, rs2853691, and rs401681 in esophageal cancer; rs10069690 in gastric cancer; rs2736100 and rs2853676 in glioma; rs2242652, rs2736098, rs2736100, rs2853677, rs31489, rs401681, rs402710, rs465498, and rs4975616 in lung cancer; rs2736100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and myeloproliferative neoplasms; and rs401681 in pancreatic and skin cancer). According to data from ENCODE and other public databases, 12 variants with strong evidence might fall within putative functional regions.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper demonstrated that common variants of TERT-CLPTM1L genes were related to susceptibility to bladder, esophageal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, and skin cancer, as well as to glioma, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and, besides, the crucial function of the TERT-CLPTM1L region in the genetic predisposition to human diseases is elucidated.},

Therefore, we present a follow-up of bladder cancer patients from the greater area Lutherstadt Wittenberg, a center of the chemical industry of the former German Democratic Republic. Relapse-free survival times of 213 confirmed bladder cancer cases from the greater area Lutherstadt Wittenberg were collected between 2008 and 2009.

Genotypes of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1), rs710521, and rs9642880 were determined by standard methods. Cox models were used to evaluate differences in relapse-free survival. Clear differences in relapse-free survival could be observed for the number of relapses, multilocular tumor growth, and relapses with higher staging or grading than the primary tumor, as well as GSTT1. None of the other investigated polymorphisms showed significant impact on prognosis. This is the first study on two recently detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing that these polymorphisms may also contribute to shorter relapse-free times.},

We performed a genome-wide interaction study (GWAS) of smoking and bladder cancer risk based on primary scan data from 3002 cases and 4411 controls from the National Cancer Institute Bladder Cancer GWAS. Alternative methods were used to evaluate both additive and multiplicative interactions between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and smoking exposure.

5 were evaluated further in an independent dataset of 2422 bladder cancer cases and 5751 controls. We identified 10 SNPs that showed association in a consistent manner with the initial dataset and in the combined dataset, providing evidence of interaction with tobacco use. Further, two of these novel SNPs showed strong evidence of association with bladder cancer in tobacco use subgroups that approached genome-wide significance. Specifically, rs1711973 (FOXF2) on 6p25.3 was a susceptibility SNP for never smokers [combined odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.20–1.50, P value = 5.18 × 10−

7). In our analysis of smoking and bladder cancer, the tests for multiplicative interaction seemed to more commonly identify susceptibility loci with associations in never smokers, whereas the additive interaction analysis identified more loci with associations among smokers—including the known smoking and NAT2 acetylation interaction.

	abstract = {Background
Bladder cancer has been linked with long-term exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water.

Objectives
In this study we investigated the combined influence of DBP exposure and polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase (GSTT1, GSTZ1) and cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1) genes in the metabolic pathways of selected by-products on bladder cancer in a hospital-based case–control study in Spain.

Methods
Average exposures to trihalomethanes (THMs; a surrogate for DBPs) from 15 years of age were estimated for each subject based on residential history and information on municipal water sources among 680 cases and 714 controls. We estimated effects of THMs and GSTT1, GSTZ1, and CYP2E1 polymorphisms on bladder cancer using adjusted logistic regression models with and without interaction terms.

Results
THM exposure was positively associated with bladder cancer: adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were 1.2 (0.8–1.8), 1.8 (1.1–2.9), and 1.8 (0.9–3.5) for THM quartiles 2, 3, and 4, respectively, relative to quartile 1. Associations between THMs and bladder cancer were stronger among subjects who were GSTT1 +/+ or +/− versus GSTT1 null (pinteraction = 0.021), GSTZ1 rs1046428 CT/TT versus CC (pinteraction = 0.018), or CYP2E1 rs2031920 CC versus CT/TT (pinteraction = 0.035). Among the 195 cases and 192 controls with high-risk forms of GSTT1 and GSTZ1, the ORs for quartiles 2, 3, and 4 of THMs were 1.5 (0.7–3.5), 3.4 (1.4–8.2), and 5.9 (1.8–19.0), respectively.

Conclusions
Polymorphisms in key metabolizing enzymes modified DBP-associated bladder cancer risk. The consistency of these findings with experimental observations of GSTT1, GSTZ1, and CYP2E1 activity strengthens the hypothesis that DBPs cause bladder cancer and suggests possible mechanisms as well as the classes of compounds likely to be implicated.},

Genetic variation in enzymes involved in xenobiotic and arsenic metabolism may modulate individual susceptibility to arsenic-related bladder cancer.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GSTP1, GSTO2, GSTZ1, AQP3, AS3MT and the deletion status of GSTM1 and GSTT1 were determined. We found evidence of genotype-arsenic interactions in the high exposure group; GSTP1 Ile105Val homozygous individuals had an odds ratio (OR) of 5.4 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-20.2; P for interaction=0.03] and AQP3 Phe130Phe carriers had an OR=2.2 (95\% CI: 0.8-6.1; P for interaction=0.10).

While arsenic is a known carcinogen, recent studies suggest that it is useful as a therapeutic agent for leukemia. This study examined the relationship between arsenic exposure and bladder cancer mortality.
METHODS: We studied 832 cases of bladder cancer diagnosed in New Hampshire from a population-based case-control study. Individual exposure to arsenic was determined in home drinking water using ICP-MS and in toenail samples by instrumental neutron activation analysis.
RESULTS: Among the high arsenic exposure group, found using toenail arsenic level or arsenic consumption, cases experienced a de-escalated survival hazard ratio (HR) [high ({\textgreater} or =75 percent) versus low ({\textless}25th percentile) toenail arsenic overall survival HR 0.5 (95\% CI 0.4-0.8)], controlled for tumor stage, grade, gender, age and treatment regimen. This association was found largely among invasive tumors, in smokers and was not modified by TP53 status. Bladder cancer cause-specific survival showed a similar trend, but did not reach statistical significance [HR 0.5 (95\% CI 0.3-1.1)].

However, it is unclear whether low exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water ({\textless}100 microg/liter) is related to bladder cancer risk. No study has been known to use biomarkers to assess the relation between individual arsenic exposure and bladder cancer risk. Toenail samples provide an integrated measure of internal arsenic exposure and reflect long-term exposure. The authors examined the relation between toenail arsenic levels and bladder cancer risk among participants in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, a cohort of Finnish male smokers aged 50-69 years. Data for 280 incident bladder cancer cases, identified between baseline (1985-1988) and April 1999, were available for analysis. One control was matched to each case on the basis of age, toenail collection date, intervention group, and smoking duration. Arsenic levels in toenail samples were determined by using neutron activation analysis. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios. Arsenic toenail concentrations in this Finnish study were similar to those reported in US studies (range: 0.02-17.5 microg/g). The authors observed no association between inorganic arsenic concentration and bladder cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.13, 95\% confidence interval: 0.70, 1.81 for the highest vs. lowest quartile). These findings suggest that low-level arsenic exposure is unlikely to explain a substantial excess risk of bladder cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on the contribution of dietary sources of arsenic to an individual's total exposure, particularly in populations with exposure via drinking water. Here, the association between diet and toenail arsenic concentrations (a long-term biomarker of exposure) was evaluated for individuals with measured household tap water arsenic. Foods known to be high in arsenic, including rice and seafood, were of particular interest.
METHODS: Associations between toenail arsenic and consumption of 120 individual diet items were quantified using general linear models that also accounted for household tap water arsenic and potentially confounding factors (e.g., age, caloric intake, sex, smoking) (n = 852). As part of the analysis, we assessed whether associations between log-transformed toenail arsenic and each diet item differed between subjects with household drinking water arsenic concentrations {\textless}1 μg/L versus ≥1 μg/L.
RESULTS: As expected, toenail arsenic concentrations increased with household water arsenic concentrations. Among the foods known to be high in arsenic, no clear relationship between toenail arsenic and rice consumption was detected, but there was a positive association with consumption of dark meat fish, a category that includes tuna steaks, mackerel, salmon, sardines, bluefish, and swordfish. Positive associations between toenail arsenic and consumption of white wine, beer, and Brussels sprouts were also observed; these and most other associations were not modified by exposure via water. However, consumption of two foods cooked in water, beans/lentils and cooked oatmeal, was more strongly related to toenail arsenic among those with arsenic-containing drinking water (≥1 μg/L).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that diet can be an important contributor to total arsenic exposure in U.S. populations regardless of arsenic concentrations in drinking water. Thus, dietary exposure to arsenic in the US warrants consideration as a potential health risk.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that both exposure and genetic factors may influence susceptibility to arsenic-induced malignancies. We sought to identify novel susceptibility loci for arsenic-related bladder cancer in a US population with low to moderate drinking water levels of arsenic. We first screened a subset of bladder cancer cases using a panel of approximately 10,000 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Top ranking hits on the SNP array then were considered for further analysis in our population-based case-control study (n = 832 cases and 1,191 controls). SNPs in the fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) gene (rs10152640) and the solute carrier family 39, member 2 (SLC39A2) in the ZIP gene family of metal transporters (rs2234636) were detected as potential hits in the initial scan and validated in the full case-control study. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the FSIP1 polymorphism was 2.57 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.13, 5.85] for heterozygote variants (AG) and 12.20 (95\% CI 2.51, 59.30) for homozygote variants (GG) compared to homozygote wild types (AA) in the high arsenic group (greater than the 90th percentile), and unrelated in the low arsenic group (equal to or below the 90th percentile) (P for interaction = 0.002). For the SLC39A2 polymorphism, the adjusted ORs were 2.96 (95\% CI 1.23, 7.15) and 2.91 (95\% CI 1.00, 8.52) for heterozygote (TC) and homozygote (CC) variants compared to homozygote wild types (TT), respectively, and close to one in the low arsenic group (P for interaction = 0.03).

	abstract = {Objective
Bladder cancer (BC) has the highest lifetime treatment costs per patient of all cancers. The high recurrence rate and ongoing invasive monitoring requirement are the key contributors to the economic and human toll of this disease. The purpose of this paper was to utilize the recent literature to identify opportunities for improving the benefits and costs of BC care.

Methods
A PubMed search was performed of recent publications concerning (BC) cost-effectiveness. We reviewed studies, reviews, opinion papers and cost-effectiveness analyses, focusing primarily on non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (Ta/T1; NMIBC).

Results
New diagnostic tools such as urine markers may assist in more cost-effectively detecting BC at an earlier stage, however, these markers cannot replace the cystoscopy, which is the current standard of care. A photodynamic diagnostic tool (PDD) using hexylaminolevulinate (Hexvix®) enhances tumor visibility and improves transurethral resection of bladder cancer (TURB) results, potentially reducing recurrence rates and lowering treatment costs. While the importance of BC research has been acknowledged, research investment has been continuously reduced during the last 5 years.

Conclusions
The economic burden of BC is well-characterized in the literature. This study suggests that new technologies (i.e., urine-based tests, PDD) and therapeutic regimes (intravesical chemotherapy, adjuvant immunotherapy) have significant potential to improve the diagnosis, treatment and on-going monitoring of BC patients, with potential improvements in clinical outcomes and concurrent cost-savings. A renewed interest and investment in BC research are required to ensure future advancements.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the folate-metabolizing enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) may modify associations between folate intake and breast cancer. We examined if the association between tertiles of dietary folate equivalents (DFE) and breast cancer was different in subgroups according to genotypes of the MTHFR 677 C{\textgreater}T (rs1801133) and 1298A{\textgreater}C (rs1801131) SNPs and if the polymorphisms per se were associated with breast cancer.
METHODS: This nested case-control study included 544 incident cases with invasive breast cancer and 1,088 controls matched on age and blood sampling date from the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort. Genotyping of the MTHFR SNPs was done with PCR-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Odds ratios (OR) were obtained by unconditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: DFE was positively associated with breast cancer in MTHFR 677CT/TT-1298AA women (P for trend = 0.01) but inversely associated in compound heterozygous women (P for trend = 0.01). Interaction was observed between DFE and the 1298C allele (P = 0.03). The 677T allele was associated with increased breast cancer risk in women above 55 years [multivariate adjusted OR, 1.34; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 1.01-1.76] and an interaction was observed between the T allele and age (P = 0.03). Homozygosis for the 1298C allele was associated with increased risk in women between 45 and 55 years (multivariate adjusted OR, 1.89; 95\% CI, 1.09-3.29).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a positive association between DFE and breast cancer was observed in MTHFR 677CT/TT-1298AA women but an inverse association was observed in 677CT-1298AC women. The 677T allele was associated with higher breast cancer risk in women above 55 years of age.},

MTHFR C677T-A1298C diplotypes were associated with risk of meningioma (P = 0.002) and glioma (P = 0.02); risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR variants [odds ratio (OR), 2.11; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 1.42-3.12]. The corresponding OR for glioma was 1.23 (95\% CI, 0.91-1.66). A significant association between risk of meningioma and homozygosity for MTRR 66G was also observed (OR, 1.41; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.94). Our findings provide support for the role of folate metabolism in the development of primary brain tumors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The MTHFR C677T TT genotype is associated with a 15\% to 18\% reduction in colorectal cancer risk, but it is not clear if other variants of the gene are associated with colorectal cancer risk.
METHODS: We used a tagSNP approach to comprehensively evaluate associations between variation in the MTHFR gene and colorectal cancer risk using a large family-based case-control study of 1,750 population-based and 245 clinic-based families from the Colon Cancer Family Registry. We assessed 22 TagSNPs, selected based on pairwise r(2) {\textgreater}95\%, using the Haploview Tagger and genotyped the TagSNPs on the Illumina GoldenGate or Sequenom platforms. The association between single nucleotide polymorphisms and colorectal cancer was assessed using log-additive, codominant, and recessive models.
RESULTS: From studying the population-based families, the C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) polymorphisms were associated with a decreased colorectal cancer risk overall [odds ratio (OR), 0.81; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 0.63-1.04; and OR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.64-1.07, respectively]. The 677 TT genotype was associated with a decreased risk of microsatellite-stable/microsatellite-low tumors (OR, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.49-0.97) and an increased risk of microsatellite-high tumors (OR, 2.22; 95\% CI, 0.91-5.43; P(interaction) = 0.01), as well as an increased risk of proximal cancers and a decreased risk of distal and rectal cancers (P(interaction) = 0.02). No other single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with risk overall or within subgroups.
CONCLUSION: The 677 TT and 1298 CC genotypes may each be associated with a decrease in colorectal cancer risk. We observed little evidence of additional genetic variability in the MTHFR gene relevant to colorectal cancer risk.},

	doi = {10.1086/432265},
	abstract = {Evolutionary genetics has recently made enormous progress in understanding how genetic variation maps into phenotypic variation. However why some traits are phenotypically invariant despite apparent genetic and environmental changes has remained a major puzzle. In the 1940s, Conrad Hal Waddington coined the concept and term "canalization" to describe the robustness of phenotypes to perturbation; a similar concept was proposed by Waddington's contemporary Ivan Ivanovich Schmalhausen. This paper reviews what has been learned about canalization since Waddington. Canalization implies that a genotype's phenotype remains relatively invariant when individuals of a particular genotype are exposed to different environments (environmental canalization) or when individuals of the same single- or multilocus genotype differ in their genetic background (genetic canalization). Consequently, genetic canalization can be viewed as a particular kind of epistasis, and environmental canalization and phenotypic plasticity are two aspects of the same phenomenon. Canalization results in the accumulation of phenotypically cryptic genetic variation, which can be released after a "decanalizing" event. Thus, canalized genotypes maintain a cryptic potential for expressing particular phenotypes, which are only uncovered under particular decanalizing environmental or genetic conditions. Selection may then act on this newly released genetic variation. The accumulation of cryptic genetic variation by canalization may therefore increase evolvability at the population level by leading to phenotypic diversification under decanalizing conditions. On the other hand, under canalizing conditions, a major part of the segregating genetic variation may remain phenotypically cryptic; canalization may therefore, at least temporarily, constrain phenotypic evolution. Mechanistically, canalization can be understood in terms of transmission patterns, such as epistasis, pleiotropy, and genotype by environment interactions, and in terms of genetic redundancy, modularity, and emergent properties of gene networks and biochemical pathways. While different forms of selection can favor canalization, the requirements for its evolution are typically rather restrictive. Although there are several methods to detect canalization, there are still serious problems with unambiguously demonstrating canalization, particularly its adaptive value.},

METHODS: The relationship between CASC15 and tumors was analyzed by searching references, and summarized the specific pathophysiological mechanism of CASC15.
RESULTS: LncRNA CASC15 is closely related to tumor development, and has been shown to be abnormally high expressed in all kinds of tumors, including breast cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, cardiac hypertrophy, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, leukemia, melanoma, tongue squamous cell carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, CASC15 has been found to be down-expressed abnormally in ovarian cancer, glioma and neuroblastoma. Besides, it is identified that CASC15 can affect the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of tumors.
CONCLUSION: LncRNA CASC15 has the potential to become a new therapeutic target or marker for a variety of tumors.},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of 29 publications with a total of 91263 cases and 735952 controls. We assessed the strength of the association between rs401681 and overall cancers risk and performed subgroup analyses by cancer type, ethnicity, source of control, sample size and expected power. Rs401681 C allele was found to be associated with marginally increased cancers risk, with per allele OR of 1.04 (95\%CI = 1.00-1.08, P(heterogeneity){\textless}0.001) and an expected power of 1.000. Following further stratified analyses, the increased cancers risk were discovered in subgroups of lung, bladder, prostate, basal cell carcinomas and Asians, while a declined risk of pancreatic cancer and melanoma were detected.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggested that rs401681 C allele was a low-penetrance risk allele for the development of cancers of lung, bladder, prostate and basal cell carcinoma, but a potential protective allele for melanoma and pancreatic cancer.},

The controls were frequency-matched to the cases by age (± 5 years), ethnicity, and smoking status. We also measured serum levels of total homocysteine (tHcy), folate, and vitamin B12. It was found that the 1298AC (odds ratio, OR = 3.74; 95\% confidence interval, CI = 2.34-5.47; P = 0.001) and 1298CC (OR = 3.46, 95\% CI = 2.37-5.52; P = 0.001) genotypes of MTHFR A1298C were significantly associated with increased risk of bladder TCC. The MTHFR C677T and G1793A polymorphisms were not associated with bladder TCC. After stratification for grade and stage, we observed that the 677TT (OR = 4.47, 95\% CI = 2.74-6.72; P = 0.001) and MTHFR 1298CC (OR = 4.78, 95\% CI = 2.82-6.89; P = 0.001) genotypes of MTHFR were associated with increased risk of muscle-invasive bladder TCC. We also found that the MTHFR 677CT+1298AA genotypes were associated with an approximately 70\% reduction in risk of bladder cancer (OR = 0.31; 95\% CI = 0.15-0.68) compared to the combined referent genotype. There were 8 haplotypes and 16 haplotype genotypes based on these three variants. When we used the haplotypes and assumed that the 677T, 1298C, and 1793G alleles were risk alleles, the adjusted odds ratios increased as the number of risk alleles increased: 1.00 for 0-1 variant, 1.88 (1.4-2.7) for any two risk alleles and 2.07 (1.6-2.8) for any three risk alleles. Serum tHcy levels were significantly higher in carriers of the 677T, 1298C, and 1793G alleles compared to noncarriers (all P {\textless} 0.01).

Overall, the MTHFR Ala222Val polymorphism was not associated with the development of bladder cancer in all genetic models (Ala/Ala vs. Val/Val--OR = 0.961, 95 \% CI = 0.763-1.209; Ala/Ala vs. Ala/Val--OR = 0.918, 95 \% CI = 0.795-1.060--Ala/Val vs. Val/Val--OR = 1.022, 95 \% CI = 0.852-1.227; dominant model--OR = 0.998, 95 \% CI = 0.869-1.145; recessive model--OR = 0.921, 95 \% CI = 0.794-1.069; Ala allele vs. Val allele--OR = 0.957, 95 \% CI = 0.857-1.067). In the stratified analyses, no significant associations were found among different descent populations and sources of controls. Our meta-analysis suggests that the MTHFR Ala222Val polymorphism not contributes to the development of bladder cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) Ala222Val (rs1801133) has been implicated to alter the risk of bladder cancer, but the results are controversial.
METHODS: A comprehensive databases of Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) were searched for case-control studies investigating the association between MTHFR Ala222Val polymorphism and bladder cancer susceptibility. Odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) were used to assess this possible association. A χ2-based Q-test was used to examine the heterogeneity assumption. Begg's and Egger's test were used to examine the potential publication bias. The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether our assumptions or decisions have a major effect on the results of the review. Statistical analysis was performed with the software program Stata 12.0.
RESULTS: A total of 15 independent studies were identified, including 3,570 cases and 3,926 controls. Our analysis suggested that Ala222Val was not associated with bladder cancer risk in overall population under additive model (OR=0.96, 95\%CI=0.76-1.21, P=0.731), dominant model (OR=1.00, 95\%CI=0.87-1.15, P=0.975), recessive model (OR=0.92, 95\%CI=0.79-1.07, P=0.279), and Ala allele versus Val allele (OR=0.96, 95\%CI=0.86-1.07, P=0.427). In the subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity and sources of controls, there were also no significant associations detected among different descent populations, population-based studies and hospital-based studies.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed the evidence that MTHFR Ala222Val polymorphism was not contributed to the development of bladder cancer.

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic is highly toxic and carcinogenic to humans. Exposed individuals vary in their ability to metabolize arsenic, and variability in arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME) is associated with risks of arsenic-related toxicities. Inherited genetic variation in the 10q24.32 region, near the arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) gene, is associated with urine-based measures of AME in multiple arsenic-exposed populations. To identify potential causal variants in this region, we applied fine mapping approaches to targeted sequencing data generated for exposed individuals from Bangladeshi, American Indian, and European American populations (n = 2,357, 557, and 648 respectively). We identified three independent association signals for Bangladeshis, two for American Indians, and one for European Americans. The size of the confidence sets for each signal varied from 4 to 85 variants. There was one signal shared across all three populations, represented by the same SNP in American Indians and European Americans (rs191177668) and in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a lead SNP in Bangladesh (rs145537350). Beyond this shared signal, differences in LD patterns, minor allele frequency (MAF) (e.g., rs12573221 {\textasciitilde}13\% in Bangladesh {\textasciitilde}0.2\% among American Indians), and/or heterogeneity in effect sizes across populations likely contributed to the apparent population specificity of the additional identified signals. One of our potential causal variants influences AS3MT expression and nearby DNA methylation in numerous GTEx tissue types (with rs4919690 as a likely causal variant). Several SNPs in our confidence sets overlap transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory elements (from ENCODE). Taken together, our analyses reveal multiple potential causal variants in the 10q24.32 region influencing AME, including a variant shared across populations, and elucidate potential biological mechanisms underlying the impact of genetic variation on AME.},

Several genetic polymorphisms and haplotypes have been considered in an attempt to optimise therapy with specific drugs but, up to now, their clinical applications remain limited. 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a key enzyme of one-carbon metabolism, catalyses the irreversible conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Two common non-synonymous variants, the C677T (Ala222Val) and A1298C (Glu429Ala), were described for the MTHFR gene and associated with a decreased enzymatic activity and an alteration of intracellular folate distribution. Other MTHFR polymorphisms with marginal impact on enzymatic activity were also reported. Several published clinical studies have investigated the potential predictive role of C677T and A1298C genetic variants on toxicity and efficacy of antifolate and fluoropyrimidine agents, such as methotrexate (MTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and raltitrexed. Many of these studies show significant associations with MTHFR variants, but others report neither association nor opposite results. A significant interaction between MTHFR polymorphisms and nutrient/environmental factors (i.e. folate status) as well as the ethnicity was reported. Finally, a haplotype approach and the combined analysis of multiple folate pathway gene variants seem to provide a more comprehensive strategy compared to single-locus investigations. The aim of this review is to critically analyse the available data on the importance of MTHFR polymorphisms in modulating the clinical outcome of antifolate and fluoropyrimidine therapies.},

Metabolism of inorganic arsenic (iAs) is subject to inter-individual variability, which is explained partly by genetic determinants.

Objectives:

We investigated the association of genetic variants with arsenic species and principal components of arsenic species in the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS).

Methods:

We examined variants previously associated with cardiometabolic traits ({\textasciitilde} 200,000 from Illumina Cardio MetaboChip) or arsenic metabolism and toxicity (670) among 2,428 American Indian participants in the SHFS. Urine arsenic species were measured by high performance liquid chromatography–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS), and percent arsenic species [iAs, monomethylarsonate (MMA), and dimethylarsinate (DMA), divided by their sum × 100] were logit transformed. We created two orthogonal principal components that summarized iAs, MMA, and DMA and were also phenotypes for genetic analyses. Linear regression was performed for each phenotype, dependent on allele dosage of the variant. Models accounted for familial relatedness and were adjusted for age, sex, total arsenic levels, and population stratification. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were stratified by study site and were meta-analyzed. Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple testing.

Results:

Variants at 10q24 were statistically significant for all percent arsenic species and principal components of arsenic species. The index SNP for iAs\%, MMA\%, and DMA\% (rs12768205) and for the principal components (rs3740394, rs3740393) were located near AS3MT, whose gene product catalyzes methylation of iAs to MMA and DMA. Among the candidate arsenic variant associations, functional SNPs in AS3MT and 10q24 were most significant (p {\textless} 9.33 × 10–5).

Conclusions:

This hypothesis-driven association study supports the role of common variants in arsenic metabolism, particularly AS3MT and 10q24.

Arsenic (+3) methyltransferase (AS3MT) is the primary enzyme involved in arsenic metabolism, and we previously demonstrated in vitro that N-6 adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase 1 (N6AMT1) also methylates the toxic inorganic arsenic (iAs) metabolite, monomethylarsonous acid (MMA), to the less toxic dimethylarsonic acid (DMA). Here, we evaluated whether AS3MT and N6AMT1 gene polymorphisms alter arsenic methylation and impact iAs-related cancer risks. We assessed AS3MT and N6AMT1 polymorphisms and urinary arsenic metabolites (\%iAs, \%MMA, \%DMA) in 722 subjects from an arsenic-cancer case-control study in a uniquely exposed area in northern Chile. Polymorphisms were genotyped using a custom designed multiplex, ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay for 6 AS3MT SNPs and 14 tag SNPs in the N6AMT1 gene. We found several AS3MT polymorphisms associated with both urinary arsenic metabolite profiles and cancer risk. For example, compared to wildtypes, individuals carrying minor alleles in AS3MT rs3740393 had lower \%MMA (mean difference = -1.9\%, 95\% CI: -3.3, -0.4), higher \%DMA (mean difference = 4.0\%, 95\% CI: 1.5, 6.5), and lower odds ratios for bladder (OR = 0.3; 95\% CI: 0.1-0.6) and lung cancer (OR = 0.6; 95\% CI: 0.2-1.1). Evidence of interaction was also observed for both lung and bladder cancer between these polymorphisms and elevated historical arsenic exposures. Clear associations were not seen for N6AMT1. These results are the first to demonstrate a direct association between AS3MT polymorphisms and arsenic-related internal cancer risk.

Several studies have suggested that capacity to metabolize iAs may vary depending on levels of iAs exposure. However, it is not known whether the influence of variants in AS3MT on iAs metabolism also vary by level of exposure. We investigated, in a population of Mexican adults exposed to drinking water As, whether associations between 7 candidate variants in AS3MT and urinary iAs metabolites were consistent with prior studies, and whether these associations varied depending on the level of exposure. Overall, associations between urinary iAs metabolites and AS3MT variants were consistent with the literature. Referent genotypes, defined as the genotype previously associated with a higher percentage of urinary dimethylated As (DMAs\%), were associated with significant increases in the DMAs\% and ratio of DMAs to monomethylated As (MAs), and significant reductions in MAs\% and iAs\%. For 3 variants, associations between genotypes and iAs metabolism were significantly stronger among subjects exposed to water As {\textgreater}50 versus ≤50 ppb (water As X genotype interaction P {\textless} .05). In contrast, for 1 variant (rs17881215), associations were significantly stronger at exposures ≤50 ppb. Results suggest that iAs exposure may influence the extent to which several AS3MT variants affect iAs metabolism. The variants most strongly associated with iAs metabolism-and perhaps with susceptibility to iAs-associated disease-may vary in settings with exposure level.},

The methyltransferase genes were arsenic(+III oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT), DNA-methyltransferase 1a and 3b (DNMT1a and DNMT3b, respectively), phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT), and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). AS3MT expression was analyzed in peripheral blood.
METHODS: Subjects were women exposed to As in drinking water in the Argentinean Andes [n = 172; median total urinary As (U-As), 200 µg/L] and in rural Bangladesh (n = 361; U-As, 100 µg/L; all in early pregnancy). Urinary As metabolites were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Polymorphisms (n = 22) were genotyped with Sequenom, and AS3MT expression was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan expression assays.
RESULTS: Six AS3MT polymorphisms were significantly associated with As metabolite patterns in both populations (p ≤ 0.01). The most frequent AS3MT haplotype in Bangladesh was associated with a higher percentage of MMA (\%MMA), and the most frequent haplotype in Argentina was associated with a lower \%MMA and a higher percentage of DMA. Four polymorphisms in the DNMT genes were associated with metabolite patterns in Bangladesh. Noncoding AS3MT polymorphisms affected gene expression of AS3MT in peripheral blood, demonstrating that one functional impact of AS3MT polymorphisms may be altered levels of gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in AS3MT significantly predicted As metabolism across these two very different populations, suggesting that AS3MT may have an impact on As metabolite patterns in populations worldwide.},

	abstract = {Objectives
We used data from a large, population-based case-control study in New England to examine relationships between occupation, industry, and bladder cancer risk.

Methods
Lifetime occupational histories were obtained by personal interview from 1,158 patients newly diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder between 2001 and 2004 among residents of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, and from 1,402 population controls selected from Department of Motor Vehicle records (ages 30 to 64 years) or Medicare beneficiary records (65 to 79 years). Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for demographic factors, smoking, and employment in high-risk occupations other than the one being analyzed.

Results
Male precision metalworkers and metalworking/plasticworking machine operators had significantly elevated risks and significant trends in risk with duration of employment (precision metalworkers: OR=2.2; CI: 1.4, 3.4, Ptrend =0.0065; metalworking/plasticworking machine operators: OR=1.6; CI: 1.01, 2.6, Ptrend=0.047). Other occupations/industries for which risk increased significantly with duration of employment included: for men, textile machine operators, mechanics/repairers, automobile mechanics, plumbers, computer systems analysts, information clerks, and landscape and horticultural services industry workers; and for women, service occupations, health services, cleaning and building services, management-related occupations, electronic components and accessories manufacturing, and transportation equipment manufacturing. Men reporting use of metalworking fluids (MWF) had a significantly elevated bladder cancer risk (OR=1.7; 95\% CI: 1.1, 2.5),

Conclusions
Our findings for metalworkers and for MWF exposure support the hypothesis that some component(s) of MWF may be carcinogenic to the bladder in humans. Our results also corroborate many other previously-reported associations between bladder cancer risk and various occupations. More detailed analyses using information collected in job-specific questionnaires administered in this study may help to identify components of MWF that may be carcinogenic, and other bladder carcinogens to which people are exposed in a variety of occupations.},

Arsenic exposure induces the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which mediate multiple changes to cell behavior by altering signaling pathways and epigenetic modifications, or cause direct oxidative damage to molecules. Antioxidants with the potential to reduce ROS levels have been shown to ameliorate arsenic-induced lesions. However, emerging evidence suggests that constructive activation of antioxidative pathways and decreased ROS levels contribute to chronic arsenic toxicity in some cases. This review details the pathways involved in arsenic-induced redox imbalance, as well as current studies on prophylaxis and treatment strategies using antioxidants.},

Although these metalloids can both cause and cure disease, their modes of molecular action are incompletely understood. The past decades have seen major advances in our understanding of arsenic and antimony toxicity, emphasizing genotoxicity and proteotoxicity as key contributors to pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight mechanisms by which arsenic and antimony cause toxicity, focusing on their genotoxic and proteotoxic effects. The mechanisms used by cells to maintain proteostasis during metalloid exposure are also described. Furthermore, we address how metalloid-induced proteotoxicity may promote neurodegenerative disease and how genotoxicity and proteotoxicity may be interrelated and together contribute to proteinopathies. A deeper understanding of cellular toxicity and response mechanisms and their links to pathogenesis may promote the development of strategies for both disease prevention and treatment.},

Diabetes affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, many of whom will develop life-threatening complications and die prematurely. Precision medicine can potentially address this enormous problem by accounting for heterogeneity in the etiology, clinical presentation and pathogenesis of common forms of diabetes and risks of complications. This second international consensus report on precision diabetes medicine summarizes the findings from a systematic evidence review across the key pillars of precision medicine (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis) in four recognized forms of diabetes (monogenic, gestational, type 1, type 2). These reviews address key questions about the translation of precision medicine research into practice. Although not complete, owing to the vast literature on this topic, they revealed opportunities for the immediate or near-term clinical implementation of precision diabetes medicine; furthermore, we expose important gaps in knowledge, focusing on the need to obtain new clinically relevant evidence. Gaps include the need for common standards for clinical readiness, including consideration of cost-effectiveness, health equity, predictive accuracy, liability and accessibility.

	abstract = {Bladder cancer is a global health issue with sex differences in incidence and prognosis. Bladder cancer has distinct molecular subtypes with multiple pathogenic pathways depending on whether the disease is non-muscle invasive or muscle invasive. The mutational burden is higher in muscle-invasive than in non-muscle-invasive disease. Commonly mutated genes include TERT, FGFR3, TP53, PIK3CA, STAG2 and genes involved in chromatin modification. Subtyping of both forms of bladder cancer is likely to change considerably with the advent of single-cell analysis methods. Early detection signifies a better disease prognosis; thus, minimally invasive diagnostic options are needed to improve patient outcomes. Urine-based tests are available for disease diagnosis and surveillance, and analysis of blood-based cell-free DNA is a promising tool for the detection of minimal residual disease and metastatic relapse. Transurethral resection is the cornerstone treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and intravesical therapy can further improve oncological outcomes. For muscle-invasive bladder cancer, radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care with evidence supporting trimodality therapy. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated benefit in non-muscle-invasive, muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer. Effective management requires a multidisciplinary approach that considers patient characteristics and molecular disease characteristics.},

Therefore, we have begun a population-based epidemiologic case-control study in which residents of New Hampshire diagnosed with primary squamous cell (n = 900) and basal cell (n = 1200) skin cancers are being selected from a special statewide skin cancer incidence survey; patients diagnosed with primary bladder cancers (n = 450) are being identified through the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry. Exposure histories of these patients will be compared to a control group of individuals randomly selected from population lists (n = 1200). Along with a detailed personal interview, arsenic and other trace elements are being measured in toenail clipping samples using instrumental neutron activation analysis. Household water samples are being tested on selected participants using a hydride generation technique with high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In the first 793 households tested arsenic concentrations ranged from undetectable (0.01 microgram/l) to 180 microgram/l. Over 10\% of the private wells contained levels above 10 microgram/l and 2.5\% were above 50 microgram/l. Based on our projected sample size, we expect at least 80\% power to detect a 2-fold risk of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or bladder cancer among individuals with the highest 5\% toenail concentrations of arsenic.},

Participants were interviewed regarding use of their private (unregulated) wells for drinking and cooking, and each provided a sample of water and toenail clippings. All specimens were analyzed using instrumental neutron activation analysis with a sensitivity of approximately 0.001 parts per million (ppm). Trace concentrations of arsenic were detected in 15 of the 21 well water samples and in all toenail clipping samples. Among the 10 individuals who lived in areas with reportedly high arsenic levels in the water supply, the geometric mean toenail concentration was 0.39 ppm (SE, 0.12 ppm); among the other 11 persons, the geometric mean was 0.14 ppm (SE, 0.02 ppm; P = 0.005 for the difference between the two means). The overall Spearman correlation between toenail and well water arsenic was 0.67 (P = 0.009), and among those with detectable well water levels of arsenic, the Spearman correlation was 0.83 (P = 0.0001).

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. It is estimated that 2.3 million new cases of BC are diagnosed globally each year. Based on mRNA gene expression levels, BC can be divided into molecular subtypes that provide insights into new treatment strategies and patient stratifications that impact the management of BC patients. This review addresses the overview on the BC epidemiology, risk factors, classification with an emphasis on molecular types, prognostic biomarkers, as well as possible treatment modalities.

Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide with more than 2 million new cases in 2020. Its incidence and death rates have increased over the last three decades due to the change in risk factor profiles, better cancer registration, and cancer detection. The number of risk factors of BC is significant and includes both the modifiable factors and non-modifiable factors. Currently, about 80\% of patients with BC are individuals aged {\textgreater}50. Survival depends on both stage and molecular subtype. Invasive BCs comprise wide spectrum tumors that show a variation concerning their clinical presentation, behavior, and morphology. Based on mRNA gene expression levels, BC can be divided into molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like). The molecular subtypes provide insights into new treatment strategies and patient stratifications that impact the management of BC patients. The eighth edition of TNM classification outlines a new staging system for BC that, in addition to anatomical features, acknowledges biological factors. Treatment of breast cancer is complex and involves a combination of different modalities including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biological therapies delivered in diverse sequences.},

Risk factors include increased longevity, obesity, testicular diseases and tumours, and germline mutations of BRCA2. BRCA2 carriers have 80 times the risk of the general population. Men generally present with breast cancer at an older age compared with women. Histologically, MBC is often of grade 2, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, and no special type carcinoma although in situ and invasive papillary carcinomas are common. Reporting and staging are similar to female breast cancer. Metastatic lesions to the male breast do occur and should be differentiated from primary carcinomas. Until recently, MBC was thought to be similar to the usual ER positive post-menopausal female counterpart. However, advances in MBC research and trials have highlighted significant differences between the two. This review provides an up to date overview of the biology, genetics, and histology of MBC with comparison to female breast cancers and differential diagnosis from histological mimics.},

RECENT FINDINGS: The mechanistic paradigm explaining the relationship between carbohydrates and cancer risk has been contested by numerous observational studies. Carbohydrates have conventionally been ascribed a deleterious role in the field of cancer research due to previous preclinical findings. A breadth of studies suggests that complex carbohydrate intake is inversely associated with risk of a number of cancer types.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intake of carbohydrates that provide a large glycemic response has been hypothesized to increase the risk of NIDDM, whereas dietary fiber is suspected to reduce incidence. These hypotheses have not been evaluated prospectively.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the relationship between diet and risk of NIDDM in a cohort of 42,759 men without NIDDM or cardiovascular disease, who were 40-75 years of age in 1986. Diet was assessed at baseline by a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. During 6-years of follow-up, 523 incident cases of NIDDM were documented.
RESULTS: The dietary glycemic index (an indicator of carbohydrate's ability to raise blood glucose levels) was positively associated with risk of NIDDM after adjustment for age, BMI, smoking, physical activity, family history of diabetes, alcohol consumption, cereal fiber, and total energy intake. Comparing the highest and lowest quintiles, the relative risk (RR) of NIDDM was 1.37 (95\% CI, 1.02-1.83, P trend = 0.03). Cereal fiber was inversely associated with risk of NIDDM (RR = 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.96, P trend = 0.007; for {\textgreater} 8.1 g/day vs. {\textless} 3.2 g/day). The combination of a high glycemic load and a low cereal fiber intake further increased the risk of NIDDM (RR = 2.17, 95\% CI, 1.04-4.54) when compared with a low glycemic load and high cereal fiber intake.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that diets with a high glycemic load and a low cereal fiber content increase risk of NIDDM in men. Further, they suggest that grains should be consumed in a minimally refined form to reduce the incidence of NIDDM.},

Adjusted relative risk estimates comparing breast cancer risk for the highest versus the lowest category of GI/GL intake were extracted from relevant studies and combined in meta-analyses using a random-effects model. Combined estimates from six cohort studies show non-significant increased breast cancer risks for premenopausal women (relative risk (RR) 1.14, 95\% CI 0.95–1.38) and postmenopausal women (RR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.99–1.25) consuming the highest versus the lowest category of GI intake. Evidence of heterogeneity hindered analyses of GL and premenopausal risk, although most studies did not observe any significant association. Pooled cohort study results indicated no association between postmenopausal risk and GL intake (RR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.94–1.12). Our findings do not provide strong support of an association between dietary GI and GL and breast cancer risk.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We reviewed the practices of (1) evidence-based practice centers (EPCs), and (2) other organizations that conduct evidence syntheses. We developed and pilot tested a framework for identifying research gaps.
RESULTS: Four (33\%) EPCs and three (8\%) other organizations reported using an explicit framework to determine research gaps. Variations of the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes) framework were most common. We developed a framework incorporating both the characterization of the gap using PICOS elements (also including setting) and the identification of the reason(s) why the gap exists as (1) insufficient or imprecise information, (2) biased information, (3) inconsistency or unknown consistency, and (4) not the right information. We mapped each of these reasons to concepts from three common evidence-grading systems.
CONCLUSION: Our framework determines from systematic reviews where the current evidence falls short and why or how the evidence falls short. This explicit identification of research gaps will allow systematic reviews to maximally inform the types of questions that need to be addressed and the types of studies needed to address the research gaps.},

	abstract = {Background
Meta-analysis of preclinical data is used to evaluate the consistency of findings and to inform the design and conduct of future studies. Unlike clinical meta-analysis, preclinical data often involve many heterogeneous studies reporting outcomes from a small number of animals. Here, we review the methodological challenges in preclinical meta-analysis in estimating and explaining heterogeneity in treatment effects.

Methods
Assuming aggregate-level data, we focus on two topics: (1) estimation of heterogeneity using commonly used methods in preclinical meta-analysis: method of moments (DerSimonian and Laird; DL), maximum likelihood (restricted maximum likelihood; REML) and Bayesian approach; (2) comparison of univariate versus multivariable meta-regression for adjusting estimated treatment effects for heterogeneity. Using data from a systematic review on the efficacy of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in animals with stroke, we compare these methods, and explore the impact of multiple covariates on the treatment effects.

Results
We observed that the three methods for estimating heterogeneity yielded similar estimates for the overall effect, but different estimates for between-study variability. The proportion of heterogeneity explained by a covariate is estimated larger using REML and the Bayesian method as compared with DL. Multivariable meta-regression explains more heterogeneity than univariate meta-regression.

Conclusions
Our findings highlight the importance of careful selection of the estimation method and the use of multivariable meta-regression to explain heterogeneity. There was no difference between REML and the Bayesian method and both methods are recommended over DL. Multiple meta-regression is worthwhile to explain heterogeneity by more than one variable, reducing more variability than any univariate models and increasing the explained proportion of heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the chi2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of (H) that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are associated with increased risk of breast cancer in several studies. Circulating concentrations of insulin increase with dietary consumption of high glycemic index foods, which, in turn, may influence IGF-I levels or activity, but the relevance of such dietary patterns for breast cancer risk is unclear. We investigated whether consumption of carbohydrates with high dietary glycemic index would predict risk of postmenopausal breast cancer among 63,307 United States women in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. From baseline in 1992, participants 40-87 years of age and free from cancer and diabetes, were followed for 5 years; 1442 incident breast cancer cases were documented. Diet was assessed at baseline by a validated 68-item food frequency questionnaire from which we calculated dietary glycemic index and glycemic load. Dietary glycemic index and load were not associated with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (rate ratio = 1.03; 95\% confidence interval, 0.87-1.22 and rate ratio = 0.90; 95\% confidence interval, 0.76-1.08, respectively) after adjustment for multiple breast cancer risk factors. Associations were not modified by body mass index, physical activity, hormone use, or stage of disease. Future evaluations of glycemic index and breast cancer risk may be strengthened by longer follow-up, more complete dietary information, and measurement of plasma insulin and IGF-I levels.},

Dietary intake was assessed by in-person interviews. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate associations., Results: During an average of 7.35 y of follow-up, 616 incident breast cancer cases were documented. A higher carbohydrate intake was associated with a higher risk of premenopausal breast cancer (P for trend = 0.002). Compared with the lowest quintile, the hazard ratios (and 95\% CIs) were 1.47 (1.00, 2.32) and 2.01 (1.26, 3.19) for the fourth and fifth quintiles, respectively. A similar pattern was found for glycemic load. The association between carbohydrate intake and breast cancer was significantly modified by age; the increased breast cancer risk associated with carbohydrate intake was restricted to women who were younger than 50 y. No significant association of breast cancer risk with glycemic index or dietary fiber intake was found., Conclusion: Our data suggest that a high carbohydrate intake and a diet with a high glycemic load may be associated with breast cancer risk in premenopausal women or women {\textless}50 y.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The intake of vegetables and fruits has been thought to protect against breast cancer. Most of the evidence comes from case-control studies, but a recent pooled analysis of the relatively few published cohort studies suggests no significantly reduced breast cancer risk is associated with vegetable and fruit consumption.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between total and specific vegetable and fruit intake and the incidence of breast cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 285,526 women between the ages of 25 and 70 years, participating in the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, recruited from 8 of the 10 participating European countries. Participants completed a dietary questionnaire in 1992-1998 and were followed up for incidence of cancer until 2002.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risks for breast cancer by total and specific vegetable and fruit intake. Analyses were stratified by age at recruitment and study center. Relative risks were adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors.
RESULTS: During 1,486,402 person-years (median duration of follow-up, 5.4 years), 3659 invasive incident breast cancer cases were reported. No significant associations between vegetable or fruit intake and breast cancer risk were observed. Relative risks for the highest vs the lowest quintile were 0.98 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.14) for total vegetables, 1.09 (95\% CI , 0.94-1.25) for total fruit, and 1.05 (95\% CI , 0.92-1.20) for fruit and vegetable juices. For 6 specific vegetable subgroups no associations with breast cancer risk were observed either.
CONCLUSION: Although the period of follow-up is limited for now, the results suggest that total or specific vegetable and fruit intake is not associated with risk for breast cancer.},

A total of 35 372 women aged 35-69 years were enrolled between 1995 and 1998 and completed a validated 217-item FFQ. The individual foods were collapsed into sixty-four main food groups and compared using Cox proportional models, adjusting for potential confounders. Hazard ratio (HR) estimates are presented per portion increase in food items. After approximately 18 years of follow-up, there were 1822, 294 and 285 cases of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer, respectively. A high consumption of processed meat and total meat was associated with an increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer. High intake of tomatoes (HR 0·87, 99 \% CI 0·75, 1·00) and dried fruits (HR 0·60, 99 \% CI 0·37, 0·97) was associated with a reduced risk of breast and endometrial cancer, respectively. Mushroom intake was associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer (HR 1·57, 99 \% CI 1·09, 2·26). Subgroup analysis by pre- or postmenopausal cancer further demonstrated an association between processed meat intake and both postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer. Intake of dried fruits was associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal endometrial cancer (HR 0·55, 99 \% CI 0·31, 0·98). Our findings suggest that while some foods may trigger the risk of these cancers, some foods may also be protective; supporting the call for further randomised controlled trials of dietary interventions to reduce the risk of cancer among pre- and postmenopausal women.},

We examined the effect of the intake of different carbohydrates, the glycemic index, and the glycemic load on breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women taking into consideration tumor estrogen receptor status. Postmenopausal women (n = 23,870; aged 50-65 y) participated in the "Diet, Cancer, and Health" study, and provided information about diet and established risk factors for breast cancer. During follow-up, we identified 634 incidents of breast cancer. Associations between carbohydrate intake and breast cancer incidence were analyzed using Cox's regression models. There was no association for intake of glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, or starch and breast cancer incidence rate, and no association for glycemic index or glycemic load after adjusting for confounding factors. Intake of different carbohydrates was not associated with breast cancer incidence rates for either estrogen receptor positive (ER+) or (ER-) breast cancer. Similarly, glycemic index and glycemic load were not associated with ER+ breast cancer after adjusting for confounding factors. A borderline significant positive association between glycemic index and (ER-) breast cancer was observed (P = 0.05). In conclusion, we found no clear associations between intake of different carbohydrates, total carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, or glycemic load and breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, when ER+ and ER- breast cancer cases were analyzed separately, no clear associations were observed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diets high in carbohydrates may result in chronically elevated insulin concentrations and may affect breast cancer risk by stimulation of insulin receptors or through insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)-mediated mitogenesis. Insulin response to carbohydrate intake is increased in insulin-resistant states such as obesity.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate carbohydrate intake, glycemic index (GI), and glycemic load (GL) and subsequent overall and hormone-receptor-defined breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort analysis of dietary carbohydrate and fiber intakes was conducted among 62 739 postmenopausal women from the E3N French study who had completed a validated dietary history questionnaire in 1993. During a 9-y period, 1812 cases of pathology-confirmed breast cancer were documented through follow-up questionnaires. Nutrients were categorized into quartiles and energy-adjusted with the regression-residual method. Cox model-derived relative risks (RRs) were adjusted for known determinants in breast cancer.
RESULTS: Dietary carbohydrate and fiber intakes were not associated with overall breast cancer risk. Among overweight women, we observed an association between GI and breast cancer (RR(Q1-Q4): 1.35; 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.82; P for trend = 0.04). For women in the highest category of waist circumference, the RR(Q1-Q4) was 1.28 (95\% CI: 0.98, 1.67; P for trend = 0.10) for carbohydrates, 1.35 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.75; P for trend = 0.01) for GI, and 1.37 (95\% CI: 1.05, 1.77; P for trend = 0.003) for GL. We also observed a direct association between carbohydrate intake, GL, and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly absorbed carbohydrates are associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk among overweight women and women with large waist circumference. Carbohydrate intake may also be associated with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.},

METHODS: All women under 50 years old with pathologically confirmed breast cancer between 2013 and 2015 who were referred to oncology clinics in the west of Iran, and 408 under-50 women referred to other outpatient clinics who were without breast or other cancers at the time of the study and 2 years later were selected as the control group. The data were collected using the middle-aged periodical care form of the Iranian Ministry of Health and analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression in Stata.
RESULTS: The most powerful risk factor for breast cancer was fried foods; the odds ratio of consuming fried foods more than once a month for breast cancer was 4.5 (95\% confidence interval, 2.1 to 9.4). A dose-response model indicated that increasing vegetable and fruit consumption up to 90 servings per month decreased the odds of breast cancer, but consuming more than 90 servings per month increased the risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate consumption of vegetables and consumption of soft drinks, industrially produced juices, fried foods, and sweets were identified as risk factors for breast cancer. In response to these findings, it is necessary to raise awareness and to provide education about healthy diets and the need to change unhealthy dietary patterns.},

Design Population based prospective cohort study.
Setting and participants Overall, 101 257 participants aged 18 and over (mean age 42.2, SD 14.4; median follow-up time 5.1 years) from the French NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2017) were included. Consumptions of sugary drinks and artificially sweetened beverages were assessed by using repeated 24 hour dietary records, which were designed to register participants’ usual consumption for 3300 different food and beverage items.
Main outcome measures Prospective associations between beverage consumption and the risk of overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer were assessed by multi-adjusted Fine and Gray hazard models, accounting for competing risks. Subdistribution hazard ratios were computed.
Results The consumption of sugary drinks was significantly associated with the risk of overall cancer (n=2193 cases, subdistribution hazard ratio for a 100mL/d increase 1.18, 95\% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.27, P{\textless}0.0001) and breast cancer (693, 1.22, 1.07 to 1.39, P=0.004). The consumption of artificially sweetened beverages was not associated with the risk of cancer. In specific subanalyses, the consumption of 100\% fruit juice was significantly associated with the risk of overall cancer (2193, 1.12, 1.03 to 1.23, P=0.007).
Conclusions In this large prospective study, the consumption of sugary drinks was positively associated with the risk of overall cancer and breast cancer. 100\% fruit juices were also positively associated with the risk of overall cancer. These results need replication in other large scale prospective studies. They suggest that sugary drinks, which are widely consumed in Western countries, might represent a modifiable risk factor for cancer prevention.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the associations of dietary macronutrients, food groups, and eating patterns with risk of breast cancer in a population-based case-control study.
METHODS: In this study among women 20-44 years of age, 568 cases with breast cancer and 1451 population-based controls were included. They completed a detailed in-person interview, a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire and were measured for anthropometric indices. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of breast cancer, adjusted for age, study site, race, education, alcohol consumption, oral contraceptive usage, smoking status, and body mass index.
RESULTS: There was no association between breast cancer risk and intake of calories, macronutrients, or types of fat. Risk of breast cancer was unrelated to intakes of a variety of food groups, including red meats, dairy, high-fat snacks and desserts, or foods high in animal fat. Increased risk was observed for high intake of a food group composed of sweet items, particularly sodas and desserts. Risk increased linearly with percent of calories from sweets and frequency of sweets intake. Consumption of sweets 9.8 or more times per week compared with {\textless}2.8 times per week was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.32 (95\% CI = 1.0-1.8). This association did not appear to be due to the high-fat foods or carbonated beverages that comprised the food group. Compared with women reporting one or two meals and snacks per day, reduced risks were noted for women reporting six or more (OR = 0.69, 95\% CI = 0.4-1.1).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a modest relationship between intakes of sweet items with risk of in-situ and localized breast cancer in young women. This relation is consistent with the hypothesized link of high insulin exposure and risk of breast cancer. There was some suggestion that women who ate many times during the day were at reduced risk of disease, which is also consistent with an insulin-related mechanism.},

METHODS: We followed 82,713 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1980 to 2016) and 93,085 women from the Nurses' Health Study II (1991 to 2017). Cumulatively averaged intakes of SSBs and ASBs from FFQs were tested for associations with incident breast cancer cases and subtypes using Cox regression models. We also evaluated the associations stratified by menopausal status, physical activity, BMI, and alcohol intake.
RESULTS: We documented 11,379 breast cancer cases during 4,655,153 person-years of follow-up. Consumption of SSBs or ASBs was not associated with total breast cancer risk: pooled HRs comparing extreme categories (≥1/day compared with {\textless}1/month) were 1.03 (95\% CI, 0.95-1.12) and 0.96 (95\% CI, 0.91-1.02), respectively. We observed a suggestive interaction by BMI using pooled data (P-interaction = 0.08), where a modestly higher risk of breast cancer with each serving per day increment of SSBs was found in lean women (HR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.11) but not among overweight or obese women (HR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.95-1.06). Moreover, in the pooled, fully adjusted analysis, compared to infrequent consumers ({\textless}1/month), those who consumed ≥1 serving of ASBs per day had a lower risk of luminal A breast tumors (HR, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.80-1.01; P-trend = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Although no significant associations were observed overall, consumption of SSBs was associated with a slightly higher risk of breast cancer among lean women. This finding could have occurred by chance and needs confirmation. Our findings also suggest no substantial increase in the risk of breast cancer with consumption of ASBs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excessive sugar intake is now recognized as a key risk factor for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, evidence on the sugar-cancer link is less consistent. Experimental data suggest that sugars could play a role in cancer etiology through obesity but also through inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms and insulin resistance, even in the absence of weight gain.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the associations between total and added sugar intake and cancer risk (overall, breast, and prostate), taking into account sugar types and sources.
METHODS: In total, 101,279 participants aged {\textgreater}18 y (median age, 40.8 y) from the French NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort study (2009-2019) were included (median follow-up time, 5.9 y). Sugar intake was assessed using repeated and validated 24-h dietary records, designed to register participants' usual consumption for {\textgreater}3500 food and beverage items. Associations between sugar intake and cancer risk were assessed by Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors (sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, medical history, and nutritional factors).
RESULTS: Total sugar intake was associated with higher overall cancer risk (n = 2503 cases; HR for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1: 1.17; 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.37; Ptrend = 0.02). Breast cancer risks were increased (n = 783 cases; HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.51; 95\% CI: 1.14, 2.00; Ptrend = 0.0007). Results remained significant when weight gain during follow-up was adjusted for. In addition, significant associations with cancer risk were also observed for added sugars, free sugars, sucrose, sugars from milk-based desserts, dairy products, and sugary drinks (Ptrend ≤ 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sugars may represent a modifiable risk factor for cancer prevention (breast in particular), contributing to the current debate on the implementation of sugar taxation, marketing regulation, and other sugar-related policies.

Linkages to national mortality and cancer databases yielded data on deaths and cancer incidence, with follow-up ending between 1998 and 2000. During a mean follow-up of 16.6 years, we observed 1,461 incident breast cancer cases. GI, GL, total carbohydrate and total sugar intake were not associated with breast cancer risk in the total cohort. However, there was evidence of effect modification of the association between GI and breast cancer risk by menopausal status (p = 0.01), the hazard ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintile level of GI being 0.78 (95\% CI = 0.52-1.16; ptrend = 0.12) in premenopausal women and 1.87 (95\% CI = 1.18-2.97; ptrend = 0.01) in postmenopausal women. The associations between GI and GL were not modified by body mass index (BMI) or by vigorous physical activity among pre- or postmenopausal women. Similarly, the associations between GI/GL and risk in postmenopausal women were not modified by BMI, vigorous physical activity, or ever use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), although the associations were slightly stronger among those who reported no vigorous physical activity (ptrend = 0.02), among those who reported ever using HRT (ptrend = 0.02) and among normal-weight women (BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m2; ptrend = 0.03). Our data suggest that consumption of diets with high GI values may be associated with increased risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women, possibly more so among subgroups defined by participation in vigorous physical activity, ever use of HRT and those who are not overweight.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Breast cancer (BC) incidence is increasing worldwide. Higher insulin resistance may potentially lead to an increased risk of BC. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) are an acknowledged dietary factor that increases insulin resistance. However, the association between SSB and BC has not been widely explored. We evaluated the association between baseline consumption of SSB and the incidence of BC among relatively young women in a cohort of Spanish university graduates.
METHODS: We evaluated 10,713 middle-aged, Spanish female university graduates (median age 33) from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort, initially free of BC. SSB consumption was collected at baseline using a validated 136-item semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Incidence of BC was confirmed by a trained oncologist using medical records. We fitted Cox regression models to assess the relationship between baseline categories of SSB consumption and the incidence of BC during follow-up. We stratified the analyses by menopausal status.
RESULTS: During 106,189 person-years follow-up, 100 incident cases of BC were confirmed. Among postmenopausal women, regular consumption of SSB was associated with a significantly higher incidence of BC (HR 2.12; 95\% CI 1.02, 4.41) in the fully adjusted model, compared to women who never or seldom consumed SSB. No association was found among premenopausal women (HR 1.16; 95\% CI 0.66, 2.07).
CONCLUSIONS: Even though the number of cases was small, in this Mediterranean cohort, we observed a direct association between SSB consumption and BC risk among postmenopausal women. Nonetheless further larger longitudinal studies are needed to support this association.},

Among postmenopausal EA women, breast cancer risk was associated with frequent consumption of energy-dense foods (OR=2.95; 95\% CI: 1.66-5.22), fast foods (OR=2.35; 95\% CI: 1.38-4.00), and sugary drinks (OR=2.05; 95\% CI: 1.13-3.70).

Among AA women, frequent fast food consumption was related to premenopausal breast cancer risk (OR=1.97; 95\% CI: 1.13-3.43), and with ER+ tumors. Energy adjustment attenuated risk estimates in AA women, while strengthening them among EA women. Frequent consumption of energy-dense and fast foods that have poor nutritive value appeared to increase breast cancer risk in AA and EA women, with differences by menopausal status and ER status.},

This prospective study investigates the association between dietary sugars (fructose and sucrose) and sugary foods and beverages in relation to combined and site-specific (breast, prostate, colorectal) adiposity-associated cancers.Methods: The analytic sample consisted of 3,184 adults, aged 26-84 years, from the Framingham Offspring cohort. Diet data were first collected between 1991 and 1995 using a food frequency questionnaire. Intakes of fructose, sucrose, sugary foods, and sugary beverages (fruit juice and sugar-sweetened beverages) were derived. Participants were followed up until 2013 to ascertain cancer incidence; 565 doctor-diagnosed adiposity-related cancers, including 124 breast, 157 prostate, and 68 colorectal cancers occurred. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations. Tests for interaction with BMI and waist circumference were conducted.Results: No associations were observed between fructose, sucrose, sugary food consumption, and combined incidence of adiposity-related cancers or the examined site-specific cancers. While total consumption of sugary beverages was not associated with site-specific cancer risk, higher intakes of fruit juice were associated with 58\% increased prostate cancer risk (HR: 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.04-2.41) in multivariable-adjusted models. In exploratory stratified analyses, higher sugary beverage intakes increased overall adiposity-related cancer risk by 59\% in participants with excessive central adiposity (HR: 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.01-2.50; Ptrend = 0.057).Conclusions: In this cohort of American adults, higher sugary beverage consumption was associated with increased cancer risk among participants with central adiposity.Impact: These analyses suggest that avoiding sugary beverages represents a simple dietary modification that may be used as an effective cancer control strategy.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that more frequent consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks would be associated with increased risk of obesity-related cancers. Associations for artificially sweetened soft drinks were assessed for comparison.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with cancers identified by linkage to cancer registries. At baseline, participants completed a 121-item FFQ including separate questions about the number of times in the past year they had consumed sugar-sweetened or artificially sweetened soft drinks. Anthropometric measurements, including waist circumference, were taken and questions about smoking, leisure-time physical activity and intake of alcoholic beverages were completed.
SETTING: The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) is a prospective cohort study which recruited 41 514 men and women aged 40-69 years between 1990 and 1994. A second wave of data collection occurred in 2003-2007.
SUBJECTS: Data for 35 593 participants who developed 3283 incident obesity-related cancers were included in the main analysis.
RESULTS: Increasing frequency of consumption of both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened soft drinks was associated with greater waist circumference at baseline. For sugar-sweetened soft drinks, the hazard ratio (HR) for obesity-related cancers increased as frequency of consumption increased (HR for consumption {\textgreater}1/d v. 1/d v. {\textless}1/month=1·00; 95 \% CI 0·79, 1·27; P-trend=0·61).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between fruit and vegetable intake during adolescence and early adulthood and risk of breast cancer.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Health professionals in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: 90 476 premenopausal women aged 27-44 from the Nurses' Health Study II who completed a questionnaire on diet in 1991 as well as 44 223 of those women who completed a questionnaire about their diet during adolescence in 1998.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident cases of invasive breast cancer, identified through self report and confirmed by pathology report.
RESULTS: There were 3235 cases of invasive breast cancer during follow-up to 2013. Of these, 1347 cases were among women who completed a questionnaire about their diet during adolescence (ages 13-18). Total fruit consumption during adolescence was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. The hazard ratio was 0.75 (95\% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.90; P=0.01 for trend) for the highest (median intake 2.9 servings/day) versus the lowest (median intake 0.5 serving/day) fifth of intake. The association for fruit intake during adolescence was independent of adult fruit intake. There was no association between risk and total fruit intake in early adulthood and total vegetable intake in either adolescence or early adulthood. Higher early adulthood intake of fruits and vegetables rich in α carotene was associated with lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer. The hazard ratio was 0.82 (0.70 to 0.96) for the highest fifth (median intake 0.5 serving/day) versus the lowest fifth (median intake 0.03 serving/day) intake. The association with adolescent fruit intake was stronger for both estrogen and progesterone receptor negative cancers than estrogen and progesterone receptor positive cancers (P=0.02 for heterogeneity). For individual fruits and vegetables, greater consumption of apple, banana, and grapes during adolescence and oranges and kale during early adulthood was significantly associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Fruit juice intake in adolescence or early adulthood was not associated with risk.
CONCLUSION: There is an association between higher fruit intake and lower risk of breast cancer. Food choices during adolescence might be particularly important.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between whole and refined grain intake and risk of incident postmenopausal breast cancer. Findings from case-control studies of whole and refined grain intake and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer have been inconclusive.
METHODS: The Iowa Women's Health Study is a prospective cohort study of women initially 55-69 years old that relates diet and other lifestyle factors to cancer risk. After exclusions a total of 29,119 menopausal women who answered a 1986 baseline and a 1989 follow-up questionnaire were followed for 9 years for incident breast cancer.
RESULTS: Compared to women who at baseline rarely ate whole grain foods, women who habitually ate whole grain had a healthier lifestyle, including a higher likelihood of prior screening mammography. The multivariate-adjusted risk of incident breast cancer was 20\% higher in women in the highest quintile of whole grain intake, compared to women in the lowest quintile of whole grain intake (95\% confidence interval 0.95-1.5; p-value for trend = 0.03). No increase in breast cancer risk was found in women who had not undergone screening mammography before 1989; the apparent increase in risk was therefore likely due to increased use of screening mammography. Refined grain intake was not associated with breast cancer risk.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with inverse but not statistically significant associations between whole grain intake and breast cancer in case-control studies, both whole and refined grain intakes are unrelated to risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in these Iowa women.},

Five predominant dietary patterns were identified by using principal components factor analysis: a plant-based diet, high in fruit and vegetables; a high-protein, high-fat diet, high in meats, eggs, fried foods, and high-fat condiments; a high-carbohydrate diet, high in convenience foods, pasta, and bread products; an ethnic diet, high in legumes, soy-based foods, rice, and dark-green leafy vegetables; and a salad and wine diet, high in lettuce, fish, wine, low-fat salad dressing, and coffee and tea., Results: The plant-based pattern was associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk (RR: 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.76, 0.95 for the highest compared with the lowest consumption quintile; P-trend = 0.003); risk reduction was greater for estrogen receptor–negative progesterone receptor–negative (ER–PR–) tumors (RR: 0.66; 95\% CI: 0.48, 0.91; P-trend = 0.03). The salad and wine pattern was associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor–positive progesterone receptor–positive tumors (RR: 1.29; 95\% CI: 1.12, 1.49); this effect was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for alcohol consumption., Conclusion: The finding that greater consumption of a plant-based dietary pattern is associated with a reduced breast cancer risk, particularly for ER−PR− tumors, offers a potential avenue for prevention.},

Incident breast cancer cases were identified through linkage with state cancer registries. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 2-sided 95\% CIs., Results: During an average of 7 y of follow-up, 5461 breast cancer cases were identified, of which 3341 cases had estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. Dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with breast cancer risk [RR for the highest quintile (Q5) compared with the lowest quintile (Q1): 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.77, 0.98; P for trend: 0.02]. The inverse association appeared to be stronger for ER−/PR− tumors (RRQ5vsQ1: 0.56; 95\% CI: 0.35, 0.90; P for trend: 0.008; 366 cases) than for ER+/PR+ tumors (RRQ5vsQ1: 0.95; 95\% CI: 0.76, 1.20; P for trend: 0.47; 1641 cases). The RRQ5vsQ1 of lobular tumors was 0.66 (95\% CI: 0.44, 0.97; P for trend: 0.04), and the RRQ5vsQ1 of ductal tumors was 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.77, 1.04; P for trend: 0.10). Fiber from grains, fruit, vegetables, and beans was not related to breast cancer., Conclusion: Our findings suggest that dietary fiber can play a role in preventing breast cancer through nonestrogen pathways among postmenopausal women.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated fiber intake during adolescence and early adulthood in relation to breast cancer (BC) risk in the Nurses' Health Study II.
METHODS: Among 90,534 premenopausal women who completed a dietary questionnaire in 1991, we documented 2833 invasive BC cases during 20 years of follow-up. In 1998, 44,263 of these women also completed a questionnaire about their diet during high school; among these women, we documented 1118 cases of BC by end of follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for BC across categories of dietary fiber.
RESULTS: Among all women, early adulthood total dietary fiber intake was associated with significantly lower BC risk (RR for highest versus lowest quintile 0.81; 95\% CI 0.72-0.91; Ptrend = .002). Higher intakes of soluble fiber (RR for highest versus lowest quintile 0.86; 95\% CI 0.77-0.97; Ptrend = .02) and insoluble fiber (RR for highest versus lowest quintile 0.80; 95\% CI 0.71-0.90; Ptrend {\textless} .001) were each associated with lower BC risk. Total dietary fiber intake in adolescence was also associated with lower BC risk (RR for highest versus lowest quintile 0.84; 95\% CI 0.70-1.01; Ptrend = .04). For the average of fiber intake during adolescence and early adult life, the RR comparing highest with lowest quintiles was 0.75 (95\% CI 0.62-0.91, Ptrend = .004).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that higher fiber intakes reduce BC risk and suggest that intake during adolescence and early adulthood may be particularly important.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estrogen is an established risk factor for breast cancer. Greater bowel motility has been associated with increased estrogen excretion and lower serum estrogen levels, suggesting that it may influence breast cancer risk. However, only one other epidemiologic study thus far, to our knowledge, has examined the relation between bowel motility and breast cancer risk.
METHODS: We prospectively examined whether bowel motility, measured by self-reported frequency of bowel movements, and related factors (constipation, laxative use, water consumption, and dietary fiber intake) were associated with incidence of breast cancer among 28,586 postmenopausal women, ages 50 to 76 years, in the Vitamins and Lifestyle study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariate-adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). From 2000 to 2005, 507 incident invasive breast cancers among the cohort were identified.
RESULTS: Women with very frequent ({\textgreater} or =3/d) bowel movements had a 46\% decreased risk compared with 1/d women (RR, 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.31-0.92), but the test for linear trend was not significant (P(trend) = 0.41). Constipation was nonsignificantly associated with increased risk (RR, 1.30 for {\textgreater} or =1/wk versus {\textless}1/y; 95\% CI, 0.87-1.95). No statistically significant associations were observed for the other study exposures: 10-year chemical laxative use, 10-year use of fiber laxatives, water consumption, and dietary fiber intake.
CONCLUSION: This study adds limited support to the hypothesis that increased bowel motility lowers breast cancer risk.},

These women were followed through 1987 to ascertain their incidence of breast cancer and other cancers and deaths from all causes, as registered in the New York State Tumor Registry and Office of Vital Statistics. Survival analysis revealed that the incidence of breast cancer increased with age, was higher among the nulliparous, was higher for those with a late ({\textgreater} 26 years) age at first pregnancy, and increased with increasing socioeconomic status--all risk factors discovered before for breast cancer. No increase in risk was related to the ingested amount of calories, vitamins A, C, or E, dietary fiber, or fat. Although dietary fat has been found to be associated with higher risk of cancer at a number of other sites, e.g., the lung, colon, and rectum, and although some previous writers have suggested an association with risk of breast cancer, the findings in three cohort studies as well as in eight substantial case-control studies are negative and suggest that a relation is far from established.},

It was found that younger and older women (possibly pre- and post-menopausal women) differ with respect to such correlations. In older women a strong correlation was found between breast cancer mortality and sugar consumption (correlation coefficient = 0.9), and a weaker correlation, possibly of marginal interest, with fat consumption (correlation coefficient = 0.7). In younger women the correlation with diet seems weak. A possible connecting link between sugar consumption and breast cancer is insulin. This is an absolute requirement for the proliferation of normal mammary tissue and experimental mammary tumours may regress in its absence. Insulin secretion occurs in response to blood glucose level and could be excessive if the regulatory mechanism is overtaxed by large sugar intake. The same mechanism might account for the increased risk of mammary cancer in diabetics.},

More than 450,000 participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study were included, of which 25,682 were reported deceased after 13 years of follow-up. Information on lifestyle, diet and vital status was collected through questionnaires and population registries. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) for death from specific causes were calculated from Cox regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. Participants reporting consumption of more than 569 g/day of fruits and vegetables had lower risks of death from diseases of the circulatory (HR for upper fourth 0.85, 95\% CI 0.77-0.93), respiratory (HR for upper fourth 0.73, 95\% CI 0.59-0.91) and digestive system (HR for upper fourth 0.60, 95\% CI 0.46-0.79) when compared with participants consuming less than 249 g/day. In contrast, a positive association with death from diseases of the nervous system was observed. Inverse associations were generally observed for vegetable, but not for fruit consumption. Associations were more pronounced for raw vegetable consumption, when compared with cooked vegetable consumption. Raw vegetable consumption was additionally inversely associated with death from neoplasms and mental and behavioral disorders. The lower risk of death associated with a higher consumption of fruits and vegetables may be derived from inverse associations with diseases of the circulatory, respiratory and digestive system, and may depend on the preparation of vegetables and lifestyle factors.},

Our study aimed to investigate the association between dietary fiber intake and breast cancer risk and to explore whether this association is modified by reproductive factors and hormone receptor status of the tumor.
METHODS: A total of 44,444 women aged 45 to 74 years from the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study were included in analyses. Dietary intake assessment was performed using a validated 138-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for breast cancer incidence were calculated by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models.
RESULTS: During 624,423 person-years of follow-up period, 681 breast cancer cases were identified. After adjusting for major confounders for breast cancer risk, inverse trends were observed but statistically non-significant. Extremely high intake of fiber was associated with decreased risk of breast cancer but this should be interpreted with caution due to limited statistical power. In stratified analyses by menopausal and hormone receptor status, null associations were observed except for ER-PR- status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that extreme high fiber intake may be associated with decreased risk of breast cancer but the level of dietary fiber intake among Japanese population might not be sufficient to examine the association between dietary fiber intake and breast cancer risk.},

Grain-containing food intakes were reported on a baseline dietary questionnaire (1991) and every 4 years thereafter. Among 90,516 premenopausal women aged 27-44 years, we prospectively identified 3235 invasive breast cancer cases during follow-up to 2013. 44,263 women reported their diet during high school, and from 1998 to 2013, 1347 breast cancer cases were identified among these women. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95 \% confidence intervals (95 \% CI) of breast cancer for individual, whole and refined grain foods. After adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors, adult intake of whole grain foods was associated with lower premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quintile: RR 0.82; 95 \% CI 0.70-0.97; P trend = 0.03), but not postmenopausal breast cancer. This association was no longer significant after further adjustment for fiber intake. The average of adolescent and early adulthood whole grain food intake was suggestively associated with lower premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs lowest quintile: RR 0.74; 95 \% CI 0.56-0.99; P trend = 0.09). Total refined grain food intake was not associated with risk of breast cancer. Most individual grain-containing foods were not associated with breast cancer risk. The exceptions were adult brown rice which was associated with lower risk of overall and premenopausal breast cancer (for each 2 servings/week: RR 0.94; 95 \% CI 0.89-0.99 and RR 0.91; 95 \% CI 0.85-0.99, respectively) and adult white bread intake which was associated with increased overall breast cancer risk (for each 2 servings/week: RR 1.02; 95 \% CI 1.01-1.04), as well as breast cancer before and after menopause. Further, pasta intake was inversely associated with overall breast cancer risk. Our results suggest that high whole grain food intake may be associated with lower breast cancer risk before menopause.

The objective of this prospective cohort study is to evaluate associations between whole and refined grains and their food sources in relation to adiposity-related cancer risk. Participants were adults from the Framingham Offspring cohort (N = 3,184; ≥18 yr). Diet, measured using a food frequency questionnaire, medical and lifestyle data were collected at exam 5 (1991-95).

Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for associations of whole and refined grains with risk of adiposity-related cancers combined and with risk of breast and prostate cancers in exploratory site-specific analyses. Null associations between whole and refined grains and combined incidence of adiposity-related cancers were observed in multivariable-adjusted models (HR: 0.94; 95\% CI: 0.71-1.23 and HR: 0.98; 95\% CI: 0.70-1.38, respectively). In exploratory analyses, higher intakes of whole grains (oz eq/day) and whole grain food sources (servings/day) were associated with 39\% and 47\% lower breast cancer risk (HR: 0.61; 95\% CI: 0.38-0.98 and HR: 0.53; 95\% CI: 0.33-0.86, respectively). In conclusion, whole and refined grains were not associated with adiposity-related cancer risk. Whole grains may protect against breast cancer, but findings require confirmation within a larger sample and in other ethnic groups.},

Adherence scores for seven WCRF/AICR recommendations (adherent = 1, partial adherence = 0.5, non-adherence = 0) were calculated using questionnaire data and summed for overall (maximum = 7) and diet only (maximum = 5) scores. Associations between baseline and time-varying adherence scores and breast cancer incidence (N = 1,827 incident cases through 2011) were evaluated using proportional hazards regression. In this cohort, 8.5\% adhered {\textgreater}4 recommendations. Adherence at baseline was not associated with breast cancer incidence. Higher overall time-varying adherence (per 0.5 point increase) was associated with lower breast cancer incidence (HR: 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.84-0.96). Adherence to physical activity, sugar beverage and red and processed meat recommendations were also associated with reduced risk. Adherence to the WCRF/AICR recommendations was low and may be associated with lower breast cancer incidence in African American women.},

We identified 29,099 cancer cases in men and 13,355 cases in women. In gender-combined analyses, added sugars were positively associated with risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (HRQ5 vs. Q1: 1.62, 95\% CI: 1.07–2.45; Ptrend = 0.01); added fructose was associated with risk of small intestine cancer (HRQ5 vs. Q1: 2.20, 95\% CI: 1.16–4.16; Ptrend = 0.009); and all investigated sugars were associated with increased risk of pleural cancer. In women, all investigated sugars were inversely associated with ovarian cancer. We found no association between dietary sugars and risk of colorectal or any other major cancer. Measurement error in FFQ-reported dietary sugars may have limited our ability to obtain more conclusive findings. Statistically significant associations observed for the rare cancers are of interest and warrant further investigation.},

It was further investigated whether the association differed by use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The study included 25,278 postmenopausal women participating in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study (1993-1997). During a mean follow-up time of 9.6 years, 978 breast cancer cases were diagnosed. Associations between intake of whole grain products and the breast cancer rate were analysed using Cox's regression model. A higher intake of whole grain products was not associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. Per an increment in intake of total whole grain products of 50 g per day the adjusted incidence rate ratio (95\% confidence interval) was 1.01 (0.96-1.07). Intake of rye bread, oatmeal and whole grain bread was not associated with breast cancer risk. No association was observed between the intake of total or specific whole grain products and the risk of developing ER+, ER-, PR+, PR-, combined ER/PR status, ductal or lobular breast cancer. Furthermore, there was no interaction between intake of whole grain products and use of HRT on risk of breast cancer.

We evaluated the association between dietary fiber and ER/PR-defined breast cancer risk stratified by postmenopausal hormone use, alcohol intake, and family history of breast cancer in the population-based Swedish Mammography Screening Cohort comprising 51,823 postmenopausal women. Fiber intake was measured by food-frequency questionnaire collected in 1987 and 1997. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated by hazard ratio derived from Cox proportional hazard regression models. During an average of 8.3-year follow-up, 1,188 breast cancer cases with known ER/PR status were diagnosed. When comparing the highest to the lowest quintile, we observed non-significant inverse associations between total fiber intake and the risk of all tumor subtypes; the multivariate-adjusted RRs were 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.69-1.05) for overall, 0.85 (0.64-1.13) for ER+PR+, 0.83 (0.52-1.31) for ER+PR- and 0.94 (0.49-1.80) for ER-PR-. For specific fiber, we observed statistically significant risk reductions for overall (34\%) and for ER+PR+ (38\%) for the highest versus lowest quintile of fruit fiber, and non-significant inverse associations for other subtypes of cancer and types of fiber. Among ever-users of postmenopausal hormone (PMH), total fiber intake and especially cereal fiber were statistically significantly associated with approximately 50\% reduced risk for overall and ER+PR+ tumors when comparing the highest to the lowest quartile, but no association was observed among PMH never users. Our results suggest that dietary fiber intake from fruit and cereal may play a role in reducing breast cancer risk.},

Materials and methods: The study includes 408 BC patients and 412 age-matched controls recruited from Near East Hospital and Dr. Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital in North Cyprus. Information regarding clinical and epidemiological characteristics was collected through a standardized interview. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression before and after adjusting for the potential confounders. Results: In addition to various recognized BC risk factors, strong associations with BC were reported from women with fertility drugs used for {\textgreater}6 cycles (OR = 3.305, 95\% CI 1.850–5.906, P {\textless} 0.001), depression (OR = 2.10, 95\% CI 1.33–3.30, P {\textless} 0.001), exposure to radiation (OR = 1.74, 95\% CI 1.02–2.98, P = 0.041), and excess consumption of oil (OR = 2.703, 95\% CI 1.62–4.48, P {\textless} 0.001) and sugar (OR = 3.42, 95\% CI 1.39–8.40, P = 0.007).

We sought to evaluate dietary glycemic load (GL) and overall glycemic index (GI) in relation to breast cancer risk in Mexican women.
METHODS: We examined dietary GL and overall GI and breast cancer risk among 475 women with histologically-confirmed breast cancer and a random sample of 1391 women from Mexico City households. Diet was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire adapted to the Mexican population.
RESULTS: The multivariate adjusted or for all women comparing the highest quartile of dietary GL with the lowest quartile was 1.62 (95\% CI 1.13-2.32; p-test for trend = 0.02) with a significant trend. In postmenopausal women, the multivariate adjusted or comparing the extreme quartiles was 2.18 (95\% CI 1.34-3.55; p-test for trend=0.005). Overall GI was not significantly associated with risk of breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: High intake of rapidly absorbed carbohydrate appears to play an important role in the risk of breast cancer in Mexican women.},

METHODS: During 20 years of follow-up of 90,534 premenopausal women who completed a diet questionnaire in 1991, 2,833 invasive breast cancer cases were documented. In 1998, 44,263 of these women also completed a questionnaire about their diet during high school; among these women, we documented 1,118 cases of breast cancer. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model relative risks (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) for breast cancer across categories of dietary carbohydrate, glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), as well as insulin load and insulin index scores.
RESULTS: Adolescent or early adult intakes of GI or GL were not associated with risk of breast cancer. Comparing women in the highest versus lowest quintile, the multivariable-adjusted RRs were 1.14 (0.95-1.38) for adolescent GI scores and 1.03 (0.91-1.16) for early adulthood GI scores. We also did not observe associations with insulin index and insulin load scores in adolescence or early adulthood and breast cancer risk.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that diets high in GI, GL, insulin index, and insulin load during adolescence or early adulthood were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in this cohort study.
IMPACT: Diets with a high glucose or insulin response in adolescence or early adulthood were not significant predictors of breast cancer incidence.},

This prospective cohort study investigates carbohydrate quantity and quality in relation to risk of adiposity-related cancers, which represent the most commonly diagnosed preventable cancers in the USA. In exploratory analyses, associations with three site-specific cancers: breast, prostate and colorectal cancers were also examined. The study sample consisted of 3184 adults from the Framingham Offspring cohort. Dietary data were collected in 1991-1995 using a FFQ along with lifestyle and medical information. From 1991 to 2013, 565 incident adiposity-related cancers, including 124 breast, 157 prostate and sixty-eight colorectal cancers, were identified. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the role of carbohydrate nutrition in cancer risk. GI and GL were not associated with risk of adiposity-related cancers or any of the site-specific cancers. Total carbohydrate intake was not associated with risk of adiposity-related cancers combined or prostate and colorectal cancers. However, carbohydrate consumption in the highest v. lowest quintile was associated with 41 \% lower breast cancer risk (hazard ratio (HR) 0·59; 95 \% CI 0·36, 0·97). High-, medium- and low-GI foods were not associated with risk of adiposity-related cancers or prostate and colorectal cancers. In exploratory analyses, low-GI foods, were associated with 49 \% lower breast cancer risk (HR 0·51; 95 \% CI 0·32, 0·83). In this cohort of Caucasian American adults, associations between carbohydrate nutrition and cancer varied by cancer site. Healthier low-GI carbohydrate foods may prevent adiposity-related cancers among women, but these findings require confirmation in a larger sample.},

	abstract = {A few studies have evaluated the association between diet and mammographic breast density (MBD) and results are inconsistent. MBD, a well-recognized risk factor for breast cancer, has been proposed as a marker of cumulative exposure to hormones and growth factors. Diets with a high glycemic index (GI) or glycemic load (GL) may increase breast cancer risk, via an effect on the insulin-like growth factor axis. We have investigated the association between carbohydrate intake, GI, GL and MBD in a prospective study. We identified a large series of women, in the frame of the EPIC-Florence cohort, with a mammogram taken five years after enrolment, when detailed information on dietary and lifestyle habits and anthropometric measurements had been collected. Mammograms have been retrieved (1,668, 83\%) and MBD assessed according to Wolfe’s classification. We compared women with high MBD (P2+DY Wolfe’s categories) with those with low MBD (N1+P1) through logistic models adjusted for age, education, body mass index, menopause, number of children, breast feeding, physical activity, non-alcohol energy, fibers, saturated fat and alcohol. A direct association between GL and high MBD emerged in the highest quintile of intake in comparison with the lowest quintile (OR = 1.73, 95\%CI 1.13–2.67, p for trend = 0.048) while no association with glycemic index was evident. These results were confirmed after exclusion of women reporting to be on a diet or affected with diabetes, and when Hormone Replacement Therapy at the date of mammographic examination used to assess MBD was considered. The effect was particularly evident among leaner women, although no interaction was found. A positive association was suggested for increasing simple sugar and total carbohydrates intakes limited to the highest quintiles. In this Italian population we observed an association between glycemic load, total and rapidly absorbed carbohydrates and high MBD. These novel results warrant further investigations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Very few studies have focused on the relationship among dietary carbohydrates, glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and breast cancer risk in Latin American women. Our objective was to assess the associations among dietary carbohydrate, GI, GL, and risk of breast cancer, and to further investigate these associations by levels of overweight/obesity and physical activity.
METHODS: We used data from a Mexican population-based case-control study. We recruited a 1,000 women with incident breast cancer and 1,074 matched control women ages 35 to 69 years between 2004 and 2007. We used conditional logistic regression models and energy-adjusted carbohydrates, GI, and GL using the residual method.
RESULTS: Total carbohydrate intake was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women. The odds ratio in the highest versus the lowest quartile was 1.3 (95\% confidence interval = 1.0, 1.7; P trend = 0.03). In stratified analyses by body mass index (BMI), the positive association between carbohydrate and risk of premenopausal breast cancer was only observed among overweight women. The odds ratio comparing the top with the bottom quartile was 1.9 (95\% confidence interval = 1.2, 3.0; P trend = 0.01) among women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m. No association was observed among women with BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that high carbohydrate diets are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal Mexican women.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prospective associations between consumption of ultra-processed food and risk of cancer.
DESIGN: Population based cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 104 980 participants aged at least 18 years (median age 42.8 years) from the French NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-17). Dietary intakes were collected using repeated 24 hour dietary records, designed to register participants' usual consumption for 3300 different food items. These were categorised according to their degree of processing by the NOVA classification.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between ultra-processed food intake and risk of overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors.
RESULTS: Ultra-processed food intake was associated with higher overall cancer risk (n=2228 cases; hazard ratio for a 10\% increment in the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet 1.12 (95\% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.18); P for trend{\textless}0.001) and breast cancer risk (n=739 cases; hazard ratio 1.11 (1.02 to 1.22); P for trend=0.02). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet (lipid, sodium, and carbohydrate intakes and/or a Western pattern derived by principal component analysis).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, a 10\% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet was associated with a significant increase of greater than 10\% in risks of overall and breast cancer. Further studies are needed to better understand the relative effect of the various dimensions of processing (nutritional composition, food additives, contact materials, and neoformed contaminants) in these associations.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk with dietary carbohydrate, fiber and sugar intake.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This population based case-control study was conducted in Malaysia with 382 breast cancer patients and 382 controls. Food intake pattern was assessed via an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and a broad range of potential confounders were included in analysis.
RESULTS: A significant two fold increased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal (OR Q4 to Q1=1.93, 95\%CI: 1.53-2.61, p-trend=0.001) and postmenopausal (OR Q4 to Q1=1.87, 95\%CI: 1.03-2.61, p-trend=0.045) women was observed in the highest quartile of sugar. A higher intake of dietary fiber was associated with a significantly lower breast cancer risk among both premenopausal (OR Q4 to Q1=0.31, 95\%CI: 0.12-0.79, p-trend=0.009) and postmenopausal (OR Q4 to Q1=0.23, 95\%CI: 0.07-0.76, p-trend=0.031) women.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the nutritional may exert effect on the breast cancer risk, it is not clear whether the role diet is the same in sedentary and physically active women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between fruit, vegetable and carbohydrate intake and the risk of breast cancer among Polish women considering their physical activity level.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted that included 858 women with histological confirmed breast cancer and 1,085 controls, free of any cancer diagnosis, aged 28-78 years. The study was based on a self-administered questionnaire to ascertain physical activity, dietary intake, sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive factors, family history of breast cancer, current weight and high, and other lifestyle factors. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in unconditional logistic regression analyses including a broad range of potential confounders.
RESULTS: With comparison of the highest vs lowest quartile of intake, strong significant associations were observed for total vegetables (OR=0.37, 95\%CI=0.20-0.69 P for trend {\textless}0.01 and OR=0.53, 95\%CI=0.29-0.96, P for trend {\textless}0.02), and total fruits (OR=0.47, 95\%CI=0.25-0.87, P for trend {\textless}0.05 and OR=0.47, 95\%CI=0.24-0.90, P for trend {\textless}0.02) among women characterized by the lowest and the highest quartile of physical activity. No associations were observed for total carbohydrate intake. Additional analysis showed a positive association for sweets and desert intake among women in the lowest quartile of physical activity (OR=3.49, 95\%CI=1.67-7.30, P for trend {\textless}0.009) for extreme quartiles of intake comparing to the referent group.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a higher consumption of vegetable and fruit may be associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, especially among women who were low or most physically active throughout their lifetimes. These findings do not support an association between diet high in carbohydrate and breast cancer. However, a higher intake of sweets and deserts may by associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among women who were less physically active.},

To determine whether intervention with a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet would reduce breast cancer incidence in women at increased risk of the disease, we carried out a randomized controlled trial in Canada. We recruited 4,690 women with extensive mammographic density and randomized them to an intervention group or a comparison group. The intervention group received intensive dietary counseling to reduce fat intake to a target of 15\% of calories and increase carbohydrate to 65\% of calories. Dietary intakes were assessed throughout using food records. Subjects were followed for at least 7 years and for an average of 10 years. The main outcome was invasive breast cancer. Percentage of calories from fat in the intervention group decreased from 30\% at baseline to 20\% after randomization and remained 9\% to 10\% lower than the comparison group throughout. There were 118 invasive breast cancers in the intervention group and 102 in the comparison group [adjusted hazard ratio = 1.19 (95\% CI: 0.91-1.55)]. Analysis of food records showed that fat intake at baseline and after randomization was not associated with total breast cancer incidence. Greater weight and lower carbohydrate intake at baseline and after randomization were associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Our findings suggest that a sustained reduction in dietary fat intake did not reduce risk of breast cancer in women with extensive mammographic density.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carbohydrate foods with high glycemic and insulinemic potential may influence cancer risk possibly through the insulin/growth-factor axis. Two staple carbohydrate foods of the Mediterranean diet, bread and pasta, have different glycemic and insulinemic responses and hence may affect cancer risk differently.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the association of bread and pasta with breast and colorectal cancer risk using data from two Italian case-control studies. These studies included 2569 women with histologically confirmed breast cancer and 1953 men and women with colorectal cancer. Controls were 2588 and 4154, respectively, admitted to the same hospitals as cases for acute, non-neoplastic conditions. Multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were obtained after allowance for relevant confounding factors.
RESULTS: The ORs of breast cancer for the highest versus the lowest quintile were 1.28 (95\% confidence interval, CI: 1.03-1.58, P-trend = 0.0342) for bread and 1.07 (95\% CI: 0.88-1.31, P-trend = 0.7072) for pasta. The association with bread remained virtually unchanged with postmenopause and overweight. The ORs of colorectal cancer in women for the highest versus the lowest quintile were 2.02 (95\% CI: 1.46-2.80, P-trend = 0.0002) for bread and 1.37 (95\% CI: 1.00-1.88, P-trend = 0.0164) for pasta. The associations remained significant only for bread in strata of menopausal status and in women with overweight. No significant associations were seen in men for either bread or pasta.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these two cancer case-control studies showed stronger positive associations with bread than pasta in women, particularly if overweight, suggesting possible hormonal-related mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Background and aims
There are theoretical reasons for suspecting that a high glycemic index (GI) or glycemic load (GL) diet may increase breast cancer risk, perhaps via an effect on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis. However observational studies have produced inconsistent findings and it is controversial whether breast cancer risk is influenced by the carbohydrate characteristics of the diet. We prospectively investigated the association between dietary GI and GL and breast cancer in the Italian section of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).
Methods and results
Women were recruited from 1993 to 1998 at five centers: Varese and Turin (north Italy), Florence (central Italy), and Ragusa and Naples (south Italy). Participants completed validated food frequency questionnaires from which GI and GL were estimated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models quantified the association between breast cancer risk and total carbohydrate intake, GI, and GL. During 11 years of follow-up, 879 breast cancer (797 invasive and 82 in situ) cases were indentified. High dietary GL was associated with increased breast cancer risk (RR 1.45, 95\% CI = 1.06–1.99; highest vs. lowest quintile; p-trend 0.029), whereas dietary GI and total carbohydrate had no influence. The association was not modified by menopausal status or body mass index.
Conclusion
Our data indicate that, in a Mediterranean population characterized by traditionally high and varied carbohydrate intake, a diet high in GL plays a role in the development of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interest in the roles of glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) in breast cancer etiology has been stimulated by indications that disease risk is linked to insulinemia, sex hormone bioavailability, and insulin-like growth factor 1.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether GI and GL were associated with the risk of breast cancer in a cohort of Italian women volunteers from Northern Italy, who enrolled between 1987-1992 in the Hormones and Diet in the Etiology of Breast Tumors Study (ORDET Study).
DESIGN: Volunteers completed a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire, and anthropometric and lifestyle data were collected. Dietary GI and GL in relation to breast cancer risk were examined in 8926 cohort women, including 289 with breast cancer identified after a mean follow-up of 11.5 y.
RESULTS: The relative risk (RR) of breast cancer in the highest (versus lowest) quintiles of GI and GL was 1.57 (95\% CI: 1.04, 2.36; P for trend = 0.040) and 2.53 (95\% CI: 1.54, 4.16; P for trend = 0.001), respectively. Total carbohydrate intake was not associated with greater breast cancer risk, but high carbohydrate from high-GI foods was. When women were categorized by baseline menopausal status and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)), the increased risk of dietary GL was confined to those who were premenopausal (RR = 3.89; 95\% CI: 1.81, 8.34) and who had normal BMI (ie, {\textless}25) (RR = 5.79; 95\% CI: 2.60, 12.90) (P for trend = 0.001 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: A high-GL diet may increase the risk of breast cancer in Italian women. The effect is particularly evident in premenopausal women and those with BMI {\textless} 25.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The glycemic potential of a diet is associated with chronically elevated insulin concentrations, which may augment breast cancer (BC) risk by stimulating insulin receptor or by affecting insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)-mediated mitogenesis. It is unclear whether this effect differs by BC phenotype.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the relation between glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and total carbohydrate intake with BC by using data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).
DESIGN: We identified 11,576 women with invasive BC among 334,849 EPIC women aged 34-66 y (5th to 95th percentiles) at baseline over a median follow-up of 11.5 y. Dietary GI and GL were calculated from country-specific dietary questionnaires. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to quantify the association between GI, GL, and carbohydrate intake and BC risk. BC tumors were classified by receptor status.
RESULTS: Overall GI, GL, and carbohydrates were not related to BC. Among postmenopausal women, GL and carbohydate intake were significantly associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor-negative (ER(-)) BC when extreme quintiles (Q) were compared [multivariable HR(Q5-Q1) (95\% CI) = 1.36 (1.02, 1.82; P-trend = 0.010) and HR(Q5-Q1) = 1.41 (1.05, 1.89; P-trend = 0.009), respectively]. Further stratification by progesterone receptor (PR) status showed slightly stronger associations with ER(-)/PR(-) BC [HR(Q5-Q1) (95\% CI) = 1.48 (1.07, 2.05; P-trend = 0.010) for GL and HR(Q5-Q1) = 1.62 (1.15, 2.30; P-trend = 0.005) for carbohydrates]. No significant association with ER-positive BC was observed.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a diet with a high GL and carbohydrate intake is positively associated with an increased risk of developing ER(-) and ER(-)/PR(-) BC among postmenopausal women.},

	abstract = {Carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, and glycemic load have been hypothesized to increase risk of breast cancer by raising insulin levels, but these associations have not been studied extensively. The insulin response to dietary carbohydrate is substantially greater among overweight women than among leaner women. Although fiber intake has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of breast cancer, data from early adult life are lacking. We examined dietary carbohydrate, glycemic index, glycemic load, and fiber in relation to breast cancer risk among 90655 premenopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study II aged 26-46 years in 1991. Diet was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire in 1991 and 1995. During 8 years of follow-up, we documented 714 incident cases of invasive breast cancer. Dietary carbohydrate intake, glycemic load, and glycemic index were not related to breast cancer risk in the overall cohort. However, the associations differed by body mass index (BMI): among women with BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m(2), the multivariate relative risks for the increasing quintiles of carbohydrate intake were 1.00 (referent), 0.87, 0.77, 0.66, and 0.62 [95\% confidence interval, 0.40-0.97; P, test for trend = 0.02]; and among women with BMI {\textgreater}or=25 kg/m(2), the corresponding relative risks were 1.00 (referent), 1.30, 1.35, 1.50, and 1.47 (95\% confidence interval, 0.84-2.59; P, test for trend = 0.14; P, test for interaction = 0.02). Similar interaction with BMI was observed for glycemic load, but not for glycemic index. Intakes of total fiber and different types of fiber were not appreciably related to breast cancer risk. Our findings suggest that the associations between carbohydrate intake or glycemic load and breast cancer risk among young adult women differ by body weight. Our data do not support a strong association between fiber intake and breast cancer risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Certain types of carbohydrates increase glucose and insulin levels to a greater extent than others. In turn, insulin may raise levels of insulin-like growth factors, which may influence breast cancer risk. We analyzed the effect of type and amount of carbohydrates on breast cancer risk, using the glycemic index and the glycemic load measures in a large case-control study conducted in Italy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases were 2,569 women with incident, histologically-confirmed breast cancer interviewed between 1991 and 1994. Controls were 2588 women admitted to the same hospital network for a variety of acute, non-neoplastic conditions. Average daily glycemic index and glycemic load were calculated from a validated 78-item food frequency questionnaire.
RESULTS: Direct associations with breast cancer risk emerged for glycemic index (odds ratio, OR for highest vs. lowest quintile = 1.4; P for trend {\textless}0.01) and glycemic load (OR = 1.3; P {\textless} 0.01). High glycemic index foods, such as white bread, increased the risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.3) while the intake of pasta, a medium glycemic index food, seemed to have no influence (OR = 1.0). Findings were consistent across different strata of menopausal status, alcohol intake, and physical activity level.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis of moderate, direct associations between glycemic index or glycemic load and breast cancer risk and, consequently, a possible role of hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance in breast cancer development.},

A diet high in fruits and vegetables, such as one represented by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet score, was associated with a lower risk of ER- breast cancer.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the results of animal studies and cross-cultural comparisons generally support a role for dietary fat in the etiology of breast cancer, results of analytic epidemiology studies are equivocal.
PURPOSE: The association between dietary fat and subsequent breast cancer was examined in a cohort of 34,388 postmenopausal women from Iowa.
METHODS: Dietary habits were assessed by a food-frequency questionnaire mailed in January 1986. Through December 31, 1989, 459 incident cases of breast cancer occurred in this cohort. Proportional hazards regression was used to examine the dietary fat-breast cancer association while adjusting for potential confounders. The effects on this association of four analytic approaches to adjustment for energy intake were also considered.
RESULTS: After adjustment for known determinants of breast cancer, a modest positive association of total fat intake with risk of breast cancer was seen. Polyunsaturated fat intake was also positively associated with breast cancer (relative risk from lowest to highest intake, 1.0, 1.25, 1.31, and 1.49; P for trend = .052). Different approaches to adjustment for energy intake, however, provided different impressions of the dietary fat-breast cancer association. One method, involving categorization of crude fat intake and inclusion of total energy intake in regression analysis, gave relative risk estimates from low to high fat intake of 1.0, 1.17, 1.25, and 1.38 (P for trend = .18). Another method, based on categorization of fat intake residuals in which the variation in fat due to total energy intake was removed, gave corresponding estimates of 1.0, 1.24, 1.30, and 1.16 (P for trend = .29). The former suggests increasing breast cancer risk with increasing fat intake; the latter suggests no association.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with other cohort studies that have shown a weak association or no association between dietary fat and breast cancer. They are also consistent with studies suggesting that fat intake is a determinant of breast cancer, particularly after accounting for inaccuracies in dietary assessment. The effects of different energy-adjustment methods may account in part for the varying interpretations of four previous cohort studies of dietary fat and breast cancer.
IMPLICATIONS: Further work is needed to clarify not only the nature of the dietary fat-breast cancer association, but also the impact of different analytic methods used in the investigation of diet-disease associations.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library searched up to 13 May 2021.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials of three or more weeks investigating the effect of diets with low glycaemic index (GI)/glycaemic load (GL) in diabetes.
OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included other markers of glycaemic control (fasting glucose, fasting insulin); blood lipids (low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, apo B, triglycerides); adiposity (body weight, BMI (body mass index), waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), and inflammation (C reactive protein (CRP)).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled by random effects models. GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: 29 trial comparisons were identified in 1617 participants with type 1 and 2 diabetes who were predominantly middle aged, overweight, or obese with moderately controlled type 2 diabetes treated by hyperglycaemia drugs or insulin. Low GI/GL dietary patterns reduced HbA1c in comparison with higher GI/GL control diets (mean difference −0.31\% (95\% confidence interval −0.42 to −0.19\%), P{\textless}0.001; substantial heterogeneity, I2=75\%, P{\textless}0.001). Reductions occurred also in fasting glucose, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo B, triglycerides, body weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure (dose-response), and CRP (P{\textless}0.05), but not blood insulin, HDL-C, waist circumference, or diastolic blood pressure. A positive dose-response gradient was seen for the difference in GL and HbA1c and for absolute dietary GI and SBP (P{\textless}0.05). The certainty of evidence was high for the reduction in HbA1c and moderate for most secondary outcomes, with downgrades due mainly to imprecision.
CONCLUSIONS: This synthesis suggests that low GI/GL dietary patterns result in small important improvements in established targets of glycaemic control, blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure, and inflammation beyond concurrent treatment with hyperglycaemia drugs or insulin, predominantly in adults with moderately controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The available evidence provides a good indication of the likely benefit in this population.

Relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95 \% confidence intervals (CI) for the highest versus the lowest categories of GI and GL were extracted from selected studies and pooled using random-effects models. Twenty reports ({\textgreater}22,000 cancer cases) have become available after January 2015, and 15 were added to the meta-analyses by cancer sites, which considered a total of 88 investigations. The five additional reports were reviewed, but not included in the meta-analyses, since data were inadequate to be pooled. For hormone-related cancers, summary RRs for the highest versus lowest GI and GL intakes were moderately increased. They ranged from 1.04 (breast) to 1.12 (endometrium) for GI and from 1.03 (prostate) to 1.22 (ovary) for GL, of borderline significance. High GI was associated with small increased risks of colorectal (summary RR for GI: 1.20, 95\% CI, 1.07–1.34—GL: 1.09, 95\% CI, 0.97–1.22, 19 studies), bladder (GI: 1.25, 95\% CI, 1.11–1.41—GL: 1.10, 95\% CI, 0.85–1.42, four studies) and kidney cancers (GI: 1.16, 95\% CI, 1.02–1.32—GL: 1.14, 95\% CI, 0.81–1.60, five studies). GL was not significantly related to those cancer sites. Stomach, prostate and lung cancers were not associated with GI and GL. The present analysis, based on an updated comprehensive evaluation of the epidemiological literature, indicates moderate unfavorable effects of high versus low GI on colorectal, and possibly bladder and kidney cancers, and a possible moderate positive association between GL and endometrial cancer.},

This study was conducted within the framework of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study, a nutritional intervention trial for primary cardiovascular prevention. We included 4010 women aged between 60 and 80 years who were initially free from breast cancer but at high risk for CVD disease. Dietary information was collected using a validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire. We assigned GI values using the International Tables of GI and GL values. Cases were ascertained through yearly consultation of medical records and through consultation of the National Death Index. Only cases confirmed by results from cytology tests or histological evaluation were included. We estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for invasive breast cancer risk across tertiles of energy-adjusted dietary GI/GL using Cox regression models. We repeated our analyses using yearly repeated measures of GI/GL intakes. No associations were found between baseline dietary GI/GL and invasive breast cancer incidence. The multivariable hazard ratio and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for the top tertile of dietary GI was 1.02 (95\% CI: 0.42-2.46) and for dietary GL was 1.00 (95\% CI: 0.44-2.30) when compared with the bottom tertile. Repeated-measures analyses yielded similar results. In sensitivity analyses, no significant associations were observed for women with obesity or diabetes. Dietary GI and GL did not appear to be associated with an increased risk for invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high CVD risk.},

The authors analyzed associations among glycemic index, glycemic load, and risk of cancer in women and men in the National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study. Published glycemic index values were assigned to 225 foods/food groups. Glycemic load was calculated by multiplying the glycemic index, carbohydrate content, and intake frequency of individual foods reported on a food frequency questionnaire. From 1995 through 2003, the authors identified 15,215 and 33,203 cancer cases in women and men, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariate relative risks and 95\% confidence intervals. For women and men, respectively, the relative risks for total cancer for high versus low glycemic index were 1.03 (Ptrend = 0.217) and 1.04 (Ptrend = 0.012) and, for glycemic load, were 0.90 (Ptrend = 0.024) and 0.93 (Ptrend = 0.01). Associations with total cancer held only among the overweight for glycemic index and among those of healthy weight for glycemic load. These findings suggest that glycemic index and glycemic load are not strong predictors of cancer incidence. The direction and small magnitude of associations might be explained by the manner in which high glycemic index and glycemic load track with overall diet and lifestyle patterns.},

Little is known, however, about whether high glycemic diets increase breast cancer risk in women. We examined the associations between baseline measurements of dietary GL and overall glycemic index (GI) and subsequent breast cancer in a cohort of 39,876 women, ages 45 years or older, participating in the Women’s Health Study. During a mean of 6.8 years of follow-up there were 946 confirmed cases of breast cancer. We found no association between dietary GL [multivariable-adjusted relative risk (RR), 1.01; confidence interval (CI), 0.76–1.35, comparing extreme quintiles; P for trend = 0.96] or overall GI (corresponding RR, 1.03; CI, 0.84–1.28; P for trend = 0.66) and breast cancer risk in the cohort as a whole. Exploratory analyses stratified by baseline measurements of menopausal status, physical activity, smoking history, alcohol use, and history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia showed no significant associations, except in the subgroup of women who were premenopausal and reported low levels of physical activity (GL multivariable-adjusted RR, 2.35; CI, 1.03–5.37; P for trend = 0.07; GI multivariable-adjusted RR, 1.56; CI, 0.88–2.78; P for trend = 0.02, comparing extreme quintiles). Although we did not find evidence that a high glycemic diet increases overall breast cancer risk, the increase in risk in premenopausal women with low levels of physical activity suggests the possibility that the effects of a high glycemic diet may be modified by lifestyle and hormonal factors. Prospective studies of a larger sample size and longer duration are warranted to confirm our findings.},

We need to re-examine the idea that we should not start a randomized control trial unless sufficient patients are available to avoid reasonable type I and II errors. Meta-analyses will come to the rescue, provided trials continue to be published at the present rate. We need to perform meta-analyses before undertaking each additional trial, and we need to base estimates of trial size on past data as well as the expected control rates and the differences we do not want to miss. In clinical trials of new interventions attempting to disprove the null hypothesis may be inappropriate because past data so often suggest or even establish that it is not true. Furthermore we need to recognize that trends (p {\textgreater} 0.05) can be both clinically and statistically important, and we must abandon the notion that if p is not {\textless} 0.05, the treatment is ineffective. In performing meta-analyses we need to worry about minimizing bias and error and consider the differences between the random and fixed effects models and between reporting results as an odds ratio versus difference in risk, with the control rates given.

	abstract = {Background
 Essential hypertension (EH) is a common and multifactorial disorder that is likely to be influenced by multiple genes. The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene rs1801133 and rs1801131 polymorphisms influence MTHFR enzyme activity and plasma homocysteine concentration. In addition, variations in MTHFR functions likely play roles in the etiology of EH. Thus far, a large number of studies investigating the associations between the MTHFR polymorphisms and EH have provided controversial or inconclusive results. To better assess the purported relationship, we performed a comprehensive analysis of 52 published studies. Objective and Methods. Eligible studies were identified by searching the PubMed, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the potential association between the MTHFR rs1801133 polymorphism and EH. 

Results
 Overall, 10712 patients and 11916 controls were involved; we observed significantly increased association between the MTHFR rs1801133 polymorphism and EH risk (such as T vs. C: OR = 1.38, 95\% CI = 1.25 − 1.54, P ≤ 0.001), with similar results evident within race subgroups (such as Asian: T vs. C: OR = 1.47, 95\% CI = 1.30 − 1.67, P ≤ 0.001; compared to Chinese: T vs. C: OR = 1.54, 95\% CI = 1.33 − 1.79, P ≤ 0.001). Similar associations were also found in subgroups defined by the source of controls and genotype methods. To our regret, based on the limited studies, no association was detected for rs1801131 polymorphism. 

Conclusions
 Our study provides evidence that the MTHFR rs1801133 null genotype may increase EH risk. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to evaluate this association in more detail.},

	abstract = {Many complex diseases are likely to be a result of the interplay of genes and environmental exposures. The standard analysis in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) scans for main effects and ignores the potentially useful information in the available exposure data. Two recently proposed methods that exploit environmental exposure information involve a two-step analysis aimed at prioritizing the large number of SNPs tested to highlight those most likely to be involved in a G×E interaction. For example,  proposed screening on a test that models the G-E association induced by an interaction in the combined case-control sample. Alternatively,  suggested screening on genetic marginal effects. In both methods, SNPs that pass the respective screening step at a pre-specified significance threshold are followed up with a formal test of interaction in the second step. We propose a hybrid method that combines these two screening approaches by allocating a proportion of the overall genomewide significance level to each test. We show that the Murcray et al. approach is often the most efficient method, but that the hybrid approach is a powerful and robust method for nearly any underlying model. As an example, for a GWAS of 1 million markers including a single true disease SNP with minor allele frequency of 0.15, and a binary exposure with prevalence 0.3, the Murcray, Kooperberg and hybrid methods are 1.90, 1.27, and 1.87 times as efficient, respectively, as the traditional case-control analysis to detect an interaction effect size of 2.0.},

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a well-characterized carcinogen, and recent epidemiologic studies have linked chronic exposures to non-cancer health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, skin lesions and respiratory disorders. Greater vulnerability has been demonstrated with early life exposure for health effects including lung and bladder cancer, immunotoxicity and neurodevelopment. Despite its well-known toxicity, there are important gaps in the regulatory oversight of iAs in food and in risk communication. This paper focuses on the US regulatory framework in relation to iAs in food and beverages. The state of existing regulatory agency toxicological assessments, monitoring efforts, standard setting, intervention policies and risk communication are explored. Regarding the approach for standard setting, risk-based evaluations of iAs in particular foods can be informative but are insufficient to create a numeric criterion, given current uncertainties in iAs toxicology and the degree to which traditional risk targets can be exceeded by dietary exposures. We describe a process for prioritizing dietary exposures for different lifestages and recommend a relative source contribution-based approach to setting criteria for arsenic in prioritized foods. Intervention strategies begin with an appropriately set criterion and a monitoring program that documents the degree to which this target is met for a particular food. This approach will promote improvements in food production to lower iAs contamination for those foods which initially do not meet the criterion. Risk communication improvements are recommended to ensure that the public has reliable information regarding sources and alternative dietary choices. A key recommendation is the consideration of meal frequency advice similar to what is currently done for contaminants in fish. Recent action level determinations by FDA for apple juice and infant rice cereal are evaluated and used as illustrations of how our recommended approach can further the goal of exposure mitigation from key sources of dietary iAs in the US.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) can exist in the environment in several different forms, each having unique chemical characteristics that influence its toxicity and potential for human and ecological exposure. Within the last decade or so, the focus on speciated As (both the inorganic and organic forms) and its potential toxicity has led to an increased availability of data on speciated As in different food types. To gain an understanding of these developments and the current science, we evaluated the state of knowledge regarding As speciation in food and calculated the average levels of several species of As measured in food. Because inorganic arsenic (inAs) is considered the most toxicologically important form of As, we focused our analysis on papers presenting information on total inAs and speciated inAs (inAs(3+) or inAs(5+)). We also evaluated speciated As forms (e.g., monomethylarsonic and dimethylarsinic acid) when presented with inAs information. Publications were drawn from the peer-reviewed literature and reports by authoritative health agencies. While a great deal of speciation data were identified, including over 6500 unique inAs data points, unclear study methodology and inconsistencies between studies introduced uncertainty into the analysis of these data. Despite these limitations, our analysis demonstrates that inAs in foods can vary widely by type and even by sample, with mean inAs concentrations ranging from undetectable (in milk) to 11,000 μg/kg (in seaweed/algae). We found a high percentage of non-measurable As in many food types, suggesting that the limits of detection of speciated As must be considered to accurately estimate dietary As exposure. The applicability of our analysis is limited by the inconsistencies and uncertainties in the available data; calculations of inAs dietary intake should be tailored to the study population of interest and should consider study quality.},

	abstract = {Objective
The ability of glutathione S-transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1) to modulate homeostasis of cellular redox and induce ferroptosis was explored in bladder cancer cells, and the involvement of the high mobility group protein 1/glutathione peroxidase 4 (HMGB1/GPX4) in these effects was studied.
Methods
BIU-87 cells stably overexpressing GSTZ1 were transfected with appropriate plasmids to deplete HMGB1 or overexpress GPX4, then treated with deferoxamine and ferrostatin-1. Antiproliferative effects were assessed by quantifying levels of ferroptosis markers, such as iron, glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), GPX4, transferrin, and ferritin.
Results
GSTZ1 was significantly downregulated in bladder cancer cells. GSTZ1 overexpression downregulated GPX4 and GSH, while greatly increasing levels of iron, MDA, ROS, and transferrin. GSTZ1 overexpression also decreased proliferation of BIU-87 cells and activated HMGB1/GPX4 signaling. The effects of GSTZ1 on ferroptosis and proliferation were antagonized by HMGB1 knockdown or GPX4 overexpression.
Conclusion
GSTZ1 induces ferroptotic cell death and alters cellular redox homeostasis in bladder cancer cells, and these effects involve activation of the HMGB1/GPX4 axis.},

	abstract = {This Review focuses on the mechanistic evidence for a link between obesity, dysregulated cellular metabolism and breast cancer. Strong evidence now links obesity with the development of 13 different types of cancer, including oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. A number of local and systemic changes are hypothesized to support this relationship, including increased circulating levels of insulin and glucose as well as adipose tissue-derived oestrogens, adipokines and inflammatory mediators. Metabolic pathways of energy production and utilization are dysregulated in tumour cells and this dysregulation is a newly accepted hallmark of cancer. Dysregulated metabolism is also hypothesized to be a feature of non-neoplastic cells in the tumour microenvironment. Obesity-associated factors regulate metabolic pathways in both breast cancer cells and cells in the breast microenvironment, which provides a molecular link between obesity and breast cancer. Consequently, interventions that target these pathways might provide a benefit in postmenopausal women and individuals with obesity, a population at high risk of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists experience deleterious side effects, including sexual dysfunction, hot flashes and osteoporosis. Estrogen may relieve or reduce some of these side effects. We explore the role of estrogen in normal male function, emphasizing sexual interest and performance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the literature on androgen deprivation therapy, estrogen and sexual function in males using PubMed® and other sources.
RESULTS: Estrogen receptors are present in tissues involved in sexual behavior including several brain centers and pelvic floor muscles. Exogenous estrogens can restore some sexual interest to greater than castrate level in castrated animals. This has also been reported for certain androgen deprived patients (eg voluntarily castrated men, male-to-female transsexuals) who take exogenous estrogens and others who are on high dose antiandrogens which increase endogenous estradiol levels. Estrogen also helps prevent hot flashes and bone mineral loss, which commonly occur with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist treatment. However, estrogen may cause gynecomastia and increases the risk of breast cancer. Thus, patients with prostate cancer should be informed about the pros and cons of estrogen therapy before starting androgen deprivation therapy. Based on these data estrogen is likely to have maximal benefits in men if initiated simultaneously with androgen deprivation therapy. Because estrogen autoregulates its own receptors, a constant dose of estrogen will not likely produce a constant serum concentration, suggesting that its effectiveness could be optimized if administered cyclically.
CONCLUSIONS: Prospective studies on the ability of parenteral estrogen to preserve sexual interest at greater than castrate level in patients with prostate cancer are warranted.},

Under certain assumptions, Mendelian randomization analysis of a genetic marker for an exposure eliminates reverse causation and confounding.We applied Mendelian randomization analysis to genetic scores, comprising 26–41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as instrumental variables (IVs) for triglycerides and low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC, HDLC), using a prospective cohort of 26 904 individuals in which there were 6607 incident cancers. We also investigated cancer risk for a SNP (rs12916) in the gene encoding hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the targeted enzyme in statin treatment. We used logistic regression and SNP pleiotropy-adjusted analyses to estimate the odds ratio per standard deviation (OR).The OR for the triglyceride IV as a predictor of any cancer was 0.91 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.80–1.03] unadjusted, and 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.78–0.95) from the pleiotropy-adjusted analysis. For the HMGCR rs12916 per LDLC-lowering T-allele, the OR was 1.09 (95\% CI: 1.01–1.18) for prostate cancer and 0.89 (95\% CI: 0.82–0.96) for breast cancer. The LDLC IV was not associated with prostate cancer or breast cancer. There were no associations between IVs and cancers of the lung, colon or bladder.Under the assumptions of Mendelian randomization, there is a causal and negative association between serum triglycerides and risk of any cancer. Further, the HMGCR genetic variant might be associated with risks of prostate and breast cancers but the biological mechanisms behind these findings are unclear, as the LDLC IV was not associated with these cancers.},

METHODS: The MEDLINE and Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE) databases were searched through July 2019 for prospective studies that reported on the association between fiber consumption and incident breast cancer. The pooled relative risk (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were estimated comparing the highest versus the lowest category of total and types of fiber consumption, using a random-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The authors identified 17 cohort studies, 2 nested case-control studies, and 1 clinical trial study. Total fiber consumption was associated with an 8\% lower risk of breast cancer (comparing the highest versus the lowest category, pooled RR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.88-0.95 [I2  = 12.6\%]). Soluble fiber was found to be significantly inversely associated with risk of breast cancer (pooled RR, 0.90 [95\% CI, 0.84-0.96; I2 = 12.6\%]) and insoluble fiber was found to be suggestively inversely associated with risk of breast cancer (pooled RR, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.86-1.00; I2 = 33.4\%]). Higher total fiber intake was associated with a lower risk of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers (pooled RR, 0.82 [95\% CI, 0.67-0.99; I2  = 35.2\%] and pooled RR, 0.91 [95\% CI, 0.88-0.95; I2  = 0.0\%], respectively). Furthermore, the authors observed a nonsignificant inverse association between intake of total fiber and risk of both estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive and estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative breast cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: A random-effects meta-analysis of prospective observational studies demonstrated that high total fiber consumption was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. This finding was consistent for soluble fiber as well as for women with premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer.},

Evidence from epidemiologic and preclinical studies demonstrates that excess sugar consumption can lead to development of cancer and progression of disease for those with cancer independent of the association between sugar and obesity.

Abstract
Per capita sugar consumption has increased in the United States to over 45 kg per year. The average person in the US currently consumes significantly more added sugar in their diet than the World Health Organization’s, the American Cancer Society’s, and the American Heart Association’s recommendations for daily sugar consumption. Evidence from epidemiologic and preclinical studies demonstrates that excess sugar consumption can lead to development of cancer and progression of disease for those with cancer independent of the association between sugar and obesity. Human epidemiologic studies and mechanistic preclinical studies in multiple cancers support a causal link between excess sugar and cancer. Preclinical studies show that high-sucrose or high-fructose diets activate several mechanistic pathways, including inflammation, glucose, and lipid metabolic pathways. Although human studies are limited, compelling human and primate studies have explored the link between added sugar and metabolic syndrome (MetS), a risk factor for cancer. Substantial evidence suggests a causal link between MetS and added sugar, indicating important implications in the association between excess sugar consumption and cancer. Human clinical trials are needed to determine whether sugar increases cancer development and progression independently of its established role in causing obesity as well as for further exploration of the mechanisms involved.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in recent years. However, the role of dietary composition in body weight regulation remains unclear. The purpose of this work was to investigate the acute effects of dietary glycemic index (GI) on energy metabolism and voluntary food intake in obese subjects.
METHODS: Twelve obese teenage boys were evaluated on three separate occasions using a crossover study protocol. During each evaluation, subjects consumed identical test meals at breakfast and lunch that had a low, medium, or high GI. The high- and medium-GI meals were designed to have similar macronutrient composition, fiber content, and palatability, and all meals for each subject had equal energy content. After breakfast, plasma and serum concentrations of metabolic fuels and hormones were measured. Ad libitum food intake was determined in the 5-hour period after lunch.
RESULTS: Voluntary energy intake after the high-GI meal (5.8 megajoule [mJ]) was 53\% greater than after the medium-GI meal (3.8 mJ), and 81\% greater than after the low-GI meal (3.2 mJ). In addition, compared with the low-GI meal, the high-GI meal resulted in higher serum insulin levels, lower plasma glucagon levels, lower postabsorptive plasma glucose and serum fatty acids levels, and elevation in plasma epinephrine. The area under the glycemic response curve for each test meal accounted for 53\% of the variance in food intake within subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The rapid absorption of glucose after consumption of high-GI meals induces a sequence of hormonal and metabolic changes that promote excessive food intake in obese subjects. Additional studies are needed to examine the relationship between dietary GI and long-term body weight regulation.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies updated to January 2015. Summary relative risks (RRs) were derived using random effects models. Seventy-five reports were evaluated in the systematic review (147,090 cases), and 72 were included in the meta-analyses by cancer site. Considering hormone-related cancers, summary RRs comparing the highest versus the lowest GI and GL intake were, respectively, 1.05 and 1.07 for breast, 1.13 and 1.17 for endometrial, 1.11 and 1.19 for ovarian, and 1.06 and 1.04 for prostate cancers. Considering digestive-tract cancers, summary RRs for GI and GL were, respectively, 1.46 and 1.25 for esophageal (squamous cell carcinoma), 1.17 and 1.10 for stomach, 1.16 (significant) and 1.10 for colorectal, 1.11 and 1.14 for liver, and 1.10 and 1.01 for pancreatic cancers. In most of these meta-analyses, significant heterogeneity among studies was observed. In subgroup analyses, case-control studies and studies from Europe tended to estimate higher RRs.

The food pattern has the advantage of taking into account the correlations that may exist between foods or groups of foods, but also between nutrients.

For the determination of dietary patterns one can use indices/scores that evaluate the conformity of the diet with the nutrition guidelines or the established patterns (a priori approach). The methods more commonly used are based on exploratory data (a posteriori): cluster analysis and factor analysis. Dietary patterns may vary according to sex, socio-economic status, ethnicity, culture and other factors, but more, they may vary depending on different associations between these factors. The dietary pattern exerts its effects on health in a synergistic way or even in conjunction with other lifestyle factors, and we can therefore refer to a ‘pattern of lifestyle’.},

	abstract = {Background
Regression to the mean (RTM) is a statistical phenomenon where initial measurements of a variable in a nonrandom sample at the extreme ends of a distribution tend to be closer to the mean upon a second measurement. Unfortunately, failing to account for the effects of RTM can lead to incorrect conclusions on the observed mean difference between the 2 repeated measurements in a nonrandom sample that is preferentially selected for deviating from the population mean of the measured variable in a particular direction. Study designs that are susceptible to misattributing RTM as intervention effects have been prevalent in nutrition and obesity research. This field often conducts secondary analyses of existing intervention data or evaluates intervention effects in those most at risk (i.e., those with observations at the extreme ends of a distribution).

Objectives
To provide best practices to avoid unsubstantiated conclusions as a result of ignoring RTM in nutrition and obesity research.

Methods
We outlined best practices for identifying whether RTM is likely to be leading to biased inferences, using a flowchart that is available as a web-based app at https://dustyturner.shinyapps.io/DecisionTreeMeanRegression/. We also provided multiple methods to quantify the degree of RTM.

Results
Investigators can adjust analyses to include the RTM effect, thereby plausibly removing its biasing influence on estimating the true intervention effect.

Conclusions
The identification of RTM and implementation of proper statistical practices will help advance the field by improving scientific rigor and the accuracy of conclusions. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00427193.},

	abstract = {The role of diet in breast cancer aetiology is unclear; recent studies have suggested associations may differ by estrogen receptor status.Baseline diet was assessed in 2000–04 using a validated questionnaire in 691 571 postmenopausal UK women without previous cancer, who had not changed their diet recently. They were followed by record linkage to national cancer and death databases. Cox regression yielded adjusted relative risks for breast cancer for 10 food items and eight macronutrients, subdivided mostly into five categories of baseline intake. Trends in risk across the baseline categories were calculated, assigning re-measured intakes to allow for measurement error and changes in intake over time; P-values allowed for multiple testing.Women aged 59.9 (standard deviation (SD 4.9)) years at baseline were followed for 12 (SD 3) years; 29 005 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Alcohol intake had the strongest association with breast cancer incidence: relative risk (RR) 1.08 [99\% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.11] per 10 g/day higher intake, P = 5.8 × 10−14. There were inverse associations with fruit: RR 0.94 (99\% CI 0.92–0.97) per 100 g/day higher intake, P = 1.1 × 10−6, and dietary fibre: RR 0.91 (99\% CI 0.87–0.96) per 5 g/day increase, P = 1.1 × 10−4. Fruit and fibre intakes were correlated (ρ = 0.62) and were greater among women who were not overweight, so residual confounding cannot be excluded. There was no heterogeneity for any association by estrogen receptor status.By far the strongest association was between alcohol intake and an increased risk of breast cancer. Of the other 17 intakes examined, higher intakes of fruit and fibre were associated with lower risks of breast cancer, but it is unclear whether or not these associations are causal.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in females and has become a major global health priority. This prospective cohort study investigated the association of dietary factors, including food items and dietary habits, with the risk of breast cancer in Korean women. Study participants were women aged 30 years or older, recruited from the National Cancer Center in South Korea between August 2002 and May 2007. They were followed until December 2014 using the Korea Central Cancer Registry to identify breast cancer cases. Among 5046 non-pre-diagnosed cancer participants, 72 breast cancer cases were prospectively identified. Participants with breast cancer had a significantly higher educational level (college or higher: 58.3\% vs. 39.5\%, p = 0.01), were more likely to have ever smoked (22.2\% vs. 7.8\%, p {\textless} 0.001), and were more likely to have a history of benign breast tumors (10\% vs. 4\%, p = 0.02) than non-cases. Consumption of grilled meat conferred a significantly higher risk of breast cancer in all women (hazard ratio (HR) 1.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–2.85) and in postmenopausal women (HR 3.06, 95\% CI 1.31–7.15). High-cholesterol food intake was associated with a higher risk in all women (HR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.01–2.82). Irregular meal intake was associated with an elevated risk in all women (HR 2.19, 95\% CI 1.20–3.98, p for trend = 0.01) and in premenopausal women (HR 2.35, 95\% CI 1.13–4.91, p for trend = 0.03). Our findings suggest that grilled meat and high-cholesterol food intake and irregular eating habits may be associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Further studies with longer follow-up periods that include information on portion size, hormone receptor status, carcinogen levels in grilled meat, and a classification of foods by source are required.},

	abstract = {Background
The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) was launched in February 2011 to increase transparency of systematic reviews (SRs). There have been few investigations of the content and use of the database. We aimed to investigate the number of PROSPERO registrations from inception to 2017, and website usage in the last year. We also aimed to explore the epidemiological characteristics of and completeness of primary outcome pre-specification in a sample of PROSPERO records from 2017.

Methods
The PROSPERO database managers provided us with data on the annual and cumulative number of SR registrations up to October 10, 2017, and the number of visits to the PROSPERO website over the year preceding October 10, 2017. One author collected data on the focus of the SR (e.g. therapeutic, diagnostic), health area addressed, funding source and completeness of outcome pre-specification in a random sample of 150 records of SRs registered in PROSPERO between April 1, 2017 and September 30, 2017.

Results
As of October 10, 2017, there were 26,535 SRs registered in PROSPERO; guided by current monthly submission rates, we anticipate this figure will reach over 30,000 by the end of 2017. There has been a 10-fold increase in registrations, from 63 SRs per month in 2012 to 800 per month in 2017. In the year preceding October 10, 2017, the PROSPERO website received more than 1.75 million page views. In the random sample of 150 registered SRs, the majority were focused on a therapeutic question (78/150 [52\%]), while only a few focused on a diagnostic/prognostic question (11/150 [7\%]). The 150 registered SRs addressed 18 different health areas. Any information about the primary outcome other than the domain (e.g. timing, effect measures) was not pre-specified in 44/150 records (29\%).

Conclusions
Registration of SRs in PROSPERO increased rapidly between 2011 and 2017, thus benefiting users of health evidence who want to know about ongoing SRs. Further work is needed to explore how closely published SRs adhere to the planned methods, whether greater pre-specification of outcomes prevents selective inclusion and reporting of study results, and whether registered SRs address necessary questions.},

	abstract = {Glycemic index (GI) describes the blood glucose response after consumption of a carbohydrate containing test food relative to a carbohydrate containing reference food, typically glucose or white bread. GI was originally designed for people with diabetes as a guide to food selection, advice being given to select foods with a low GI. The amount of food consumed is a major determinant of postprandial hyperglycemia, and the concept of glycemic load (GL) takes account of the GI of a food and the amount eaten. More recent recommendations regarding the potential of low GI and GL diets to reduce the risk of chronic diseases and to treat conditions other than diabetes, should be interpreted in the light of the individual variation in blood glucose levels and other methodological issues relating to measurement of GI and GL. Several factors explain the large inter- and intra-individual variation in glycemic response to foods. More reliable measurements of GI and GL of individual foods than are currently available can be obtained by studying, under standard conditions, a larger number of subjects than has typically been the case in the past. Meta-analyses suggest that foods with a low GI or GL may confer benefit in terms of glycemic control in diabetes and lipid management. However, low GI and GL foods can be energy dense and contain substantial amounts of sugars or undesirable fats that contribute to a diminished glycemic response. Therefore, functionality in terms of a low glycemic response alone does not necessarily justify a health claim. Most studies, which have demonstrated health benefits of low GI or GL involved naturally occurring and minimally processed carbohydrate containing cereals, vegetables and fruit. These foods have qualities other than their immediate impact on postprandial glycemia as a basis to recommend their consumption. When the GI or GL concepts are used to guide food choice, this should be done in the context of other nutritional indicators and when values have been reliably measured in a large group of individuals.},

	abstract = {Carbohydrates are increasingly being implicated in the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and their downstream cardiometabolic diseases. The “carbohydrate-insulin model” has been proposed to explain this role of carbohydrates. It posits that a high intake of carbohydrate induces endocrine deregulation marked by hyperinsulinemia, leading to energy partitioning with increased storage of energy in adipose tissue resulting in adaptive increases in food intake and decreases in energy expenditure. Whether all carbohydrate foods under real-world feeding conditions directly contribute to weight gain and its complications or whether this model can explain these clinical phenomena requires close inspection. The aim of this review is to assess the evidence for the role of carbohydrate quantity vs quality in cardiometabolic health. Although the clinical investigations of the “carbohydrate-insulin model” have shown the requisite decreases in insulin secretion and increases in fat oxidation, there has been a failure to achieve the expected fat loss under low-carbohydrate feeding. Systematic reviews with pairwise and network meta-analyses of the best available evidence have failed to show the superiority of low-carbohydrate diets on long-term clinical weight loss outcomes or that all sources of carbohydrate behave equally. High-carbohydrate diets that emphasize foods containing important nutrients and substances, including high-quality carbohydrate such as whole grains (especially oats and barley), pulses, or fruit; low glycemic index and load; or high fiber (especially viscous fiber sources) decrease intermediate cardiometabolic risk factors in randomized trials and are associated with weight loss and decreased incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality in prospective cohort studies. The evidence for sugars as a marker of carbohydrate quality appears to be highly dependent on energy control (comparator) and food source (matrix), with sugar-sweetened beverages providing excess energy showing evidence of harm, and with high-quality carbohydrate food sources containing sugars such as fruit, 100\% fruit juice, yogurt, and breakfast cereals showing evidence of benefit in energy-matched substitutions for refined starches (low-quality carbohydrate food sources). These data reflect the current shift in dietary guidance that allows for flexibility in the proportion of macronutrients (including carbohydrates) in the diet, with a focus on quality over quantity and dietary patterns over single nutrients.},

We used data from 73,542 premenopausal and 103,344 postmenopausal women from 9 European countries, taking part in the EPIC study. RRs from Cox regression models were calculated, using measured height, weight, BMI and waist and hip circumferences; categorized by cohort-wide quintiles; and expressed as continuous variables, adjusted for study center, age and other risk factors. During 4.7 years of follow-up, 1,879 incident invasive breast cancers were identified. In postmenopausal women, current HRT modified the body size–breast cancer association. Among nonusers, weight, BMI and hip circumference were positively associated with breast cancer risk (all ptrend ≤ 0.002); obese women (BMI {\textgreater} 30) had a 31\% excess risk compared to women with BMI {\textless} 25. Among HRT users, body measures were inversely but nonsignificantly associated with breast cancer. Excess breast cancer risk with HRT was particularly evident among lean women. Pooled RRs per height increment of 5 cm were 1.05 (95\% CI 1.00–1.16) in premenopausal and 1.10 (95\% CI 1.05–1.16) in postmenopausal women. Among premenopausal women, hip circumference was the only other measure significantly related to breast cancer (ptrend = 0.03), after accounting for BMI. In postmenopausal women not taking exogenous hormones, general obesity is a significant predictor of breast cancer, while abdominal fat assessed as waist–hip ratio or waist circumference was not related to excess risk when adjusted for BMI. Among premenopausal women, weight and BMI showed nonsignificant inverse associations with breast cancer. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies have related hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes to an increased breast cancer risk, an aggressive and metastatic phenotype, and a poor prognosis. Furthermore, diabetic retinopathy arises from pathological angiogenesis, which is also essential for breast cancer growth and metastasis. Insulin stimulates the proliferation of some human breast cancer cell lines in vitro by mechanisms that use both the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/Akt signaling pathways; it is also a cell survival (anti-apoptotic) agent and enhances tumor cell migration and invasive capacity. Hyperinsulinemia affects breast cancer cells via the endocrine system, but experimental studies suggest the importance of paracrine mechanisms operating by the effects of insulin on the secretion of adipokines from tumor-associated adipose tissue. In such a system, one adipokine, leptin, has stimulatory paracrine effects on breast cancer cell proliferation and survival, while a second, adiponectin, is inhibitory. Leptin, vascular endothelial growth factor, another insulin-regulated adipokine, and insulin itself also stimulate angiogenesis. Insulin has complex interactions with estrogens: it induces adipose stromal cell aromatase and tumor cell sex steroid hormone receptor expression and suppresses sex hormone-binding globulin, which may enhance estrogen synthesis and bioactivity with consequent promotion of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. All these actions influence the later steps in breast cancer development but genetic studies are also revealing connections between gene abnormalities related to type 2 diabetes and the initiation stage of breast carcinogenesis. Understanding the various mechanisms by which insulin participates in breast cancer cell biology provides opportunities for novel approaches to treatment.},

Whether these factors affect BC risk in women with inherited risk (family history, BRCA1/2 mutations, or familial cancer syndrome) remains unclear.
METHODS: This review included studies on modifiable risk factors for BC in women with inherited risk. Pre-determined eligibility criteria were used and relevant data were extracted.
RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 93 eligible studies. For women with family history, most studies indicated that modifiable risk factors had no association with BC and some indicated decreased (physical activity) or increased risk (hormonal contraception (HC)/menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), smoking, alcohol). For women with BRCA mutations, most studies reported no association between modifiable risk factors and BC; however, some observed increased (smoking, MHT/HC, body mass index (BMI)/weight) and decreased risk (alcohol, smoking, MHT/HC, BMI/weight, physical activity). However, measurements varied widely among studies, sample sizes were often small, and a limited number of studies existed.
CONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of women will recognize their underlying inherited BC risk and seek to modify that risk. Due to heterogeneity and limited power of existing studies, further studies are needed to better understand how modifiable risk factors influence BC risk in women with inherited risk.},

	abstract = {Environmental arsenic and genetic susceptibility have both been shown to increase bladder cancer risk, yet little is known about their respective interaction. We conducted a gene-environment interaction (GxE) study to characterize lifetime arsenic exposure from drinking water, inherited susceptibility, and bladder cancer risk in the New England Bladder Cancer Study. Exposures were estimated from arsenic measured in water samples collected at home and workplace. We evaluated common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) i) from the latest bladder cancer genome-wide association study (n= 28), ii) from candidate gene studies of arsenic or bladder cancer (n= 16 SNPs), and iii) SNPs from a large genome-wide association study of arsenic metabolism (n = 4 SNPs) as potential effect modifiers of the arsenic-bladder cancer relationship. We coded SNPs as the absence or presence of a risk/effect allele for bladder cancer or arsenic metabolism in 2,019 adults (928 bladder cancer cases and 1,091 controls) and arsenic exposures as tertiles. Odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, high-risk occupation, and principal components of genetic ancestry were estimated using logistic regression models. P-values for multiplicative interaction were calculated. Out of 48 SNPs, we found evidence of interaction for 7 SNPs at the statistical significance level of P\&lt;0.05. Most SNPs involved in GxE interactions are mapped to genomic regions known or suspected to function in arsenic metabolism. For the association between cumulative lifetime water arsenic (mg) and bladder cancer, the strongest evidence of an interaction was with rs1046428 (near GSTZ1 on 14q23); among those with one or two copies of the T risk allele, ORT2vsT1: 1.52, CI: 1.11 - 2.07; ORT3 vsT1: 1.44, CI: 1.05 - 1.98, Pinteraction = 0.01; among those with no risk allele copy, ORT2vsT1: 0.91, CI: 0.62 - 1.35; ORT3 vsT1: 0.97, CI: 0.65 - 1.44. For average daily water arsenic (µg/day), we found evidence of interaction among those with risk allele for rs1801133 (A/A, A/G; MTHFR on 1p36) ORT2 vsT1: 1.70, CI: 1.18 - 2.44; ORT3 vsT1: 1.53, CI: 1.06 - 2.23, Pinteraction = 0.02, in those with no copies of risk allele ORT2vsT1: 0.85, CI: 0.61 - 1.17; ORT3 vsT1: 1.11, CI: 0.79 - 1.54; and rs1801131 (G/G; G/T; MTHFR ) ORT2 vsT1: 1.59, CI: 1.14 - 2.22; ORT3 vsT1: 1.63, CI: 1.16 - 2.29, Pinteraction = 0.01, whereas in those with no risk allele ORT2vsT1: 0.84, CI: 0.59 - 1.19; ORT3 vsT1: 1, CI: 0.69 - 1.44. For 40-year lagged cumulative lifetime water arsenic (mg) and average daily water arsenic (µg/day), we found suggestive interactions with rs2234636 (SLC39A2 on 14q11), and rs1495741 (NAT2 on 8p22). Our study provides evidence of interactions between lifetime arsenic exposure and genetic variants that function in xenobiotic metabolism on bladder cancer occurrence.Citation Format: Hugo Pomares-Millan, Stella Koutros, Nathaniel Rothman, Dalsu Baris, Molly Schwenn, Alison Johnson, Debra T.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of studies have shown over-expression of cox-2 in breast cancer. Also it has been recorded that human breast cancer expresses high level of cox-2 and 12-lipoxygenase which may be beneficial in future therapy plan for those patients.
AIMS: The present study aims to examine the level of transcripts of cox-2 and 12-lipoxygenase in Egyptian breast cancer patients and to compare between the expressions of both enzymes and TNM staging, hormone receptors status (including estrogen and progesterone) and HER2/neu expression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total cellular RNA was extracted from 64 frozen tissue samples of breast carcinoma and their corresponding normal adjacent tissues. Cox-2 and 12-lipooxygenase expressions were detected using RT-PCR. Hormonal receptors as well as HER2/neu were detected immuno-histochemically for each patient.
RESULTS: About 47 and 62.5\% of carcinoma samples showed over-expression of cox-2 and 12-lipooxygenase respectively as compared to their corresponding normal tissues. The results revealed that cox-2 significantly associated with TNM staging (P = 0.0047) and hormonal receptors status (P = 0.0201). The relationship between cox-2 and HER2/neu expression was close to a significant value (P = 0.0747). 12-lipooxygenase showed only significant association with TNM staging (P = 0.0076). Neither hormonal receptors nor HER2/neu showed significant association with this enzyme.
CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of cox-2 and 12-lipoxygenase expression were detected in human breast cancer. Also, the results revealed that cox-2 and 12-lipooxygenase mRNA expressions are associated with TNM staging in human breast cancer. Furthermore, there is an inverse association between cox-2 expression and hormonal receptor status. This observation may drive us to the possible role of those two enzymes in determining the plan of therapy of breast cancer patients.},

Whether HFCS contributes directly to tumorigenesis is unclear. We investigated the effects of daily oral administration of HFCS in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutant mice, which are predisposed to develop intestinal tumors. The HFCS-treated mice showed a substantial increase in tumor size and tumor grade in the absence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. HFCS increased the concentrations of fructose and glucose in the intestinal lumen and serum, respectively, and the tumors transported both sugars. Within the tumors, fructose was converted to fructose-1-phosphate, leading to activation of glycolysis and increased synthesis of fatty acids that support tumor growth. These mouse studies support the hypothesis that the combination of dietary glucose and fructose, even at a moderate dose, can enhance tumorigenesis.},

Metastatic cancer cells generally resemble cells of the primary cancer, but they may be influenced by the milieu of the organs they colonize. Here, we show that colorectal cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming after they metastasize and colonize the liver, a key metabolic organ. In particular, via GATA6, metastatic cells in the liver upregulate the enzyme aldolase B (ALDOB), which enhances fructose metabolism and provides fuel for major pathways of central carbon metabolism during tumor cell proliferation. Targeting ALDOB or reducing dietary fructose significantly reduces liver metastatic growth but has little effect on the primary tumor. Our findings suggest that metastatic cells can take advantage of reprogrammed metabolism in their new microenvironment, especially in a metabolically active organ such as the liver. Manipulation of involved pathways may affect the course of metastatic growth.},

	abstract = {The possibility that high, long-term intake of carbohydrates that are rapidly absorbed as glucose may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes has been a long-standing controversy. Two main mechanisms have been hypothesized, one mediated by increases in insulin resistance and the other by pancreatic exhaustion as a result of the increased demand for insulin. During the past decade, several lines of evidence have collectively provided strong support for a relation between such diets and diabetes incidence. In animals and in short-term human studies, a high intake of carbohydrates with a high glycemic index (a relative measure of the incremental glucose response per gram of carbohydrate) produced greater insulin resistance than did the intake of low-glycemic-index carbohydrates. In large prospective epidemiologic studies, both the glycemic index and the glycemic load the glycemic index multiplied by the amount of carbohydrate) of the overall diet have been associated with a greater risk of type 2 diabetes in both men and women. Conversely, a higher intake of cereal fiber has been consistently associated with lower diabetes risk. In diabetic patients, evidence from medium-term studies suggests that replacing high-glycemic-index carbohydrates with a low-glycemic-index forms will improve glycemic control and, among persons treated with insulin, will reduce hypoglycemic episodes. These dietary changes, which can be made by replacing products made with white flour and potatoes with whole-grain, minimally refined cereal products, have also been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and can be an appropriate component of recommendations for an overall healthy diet.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between the glycaemic index and the glycaemic load with type 2 diabetes incidence is controversial. We aimed to evaluate this association in an international cohort with diverse glycaemic index and glycaemic load diets.
METHODS: The PURE study is a prospective cohort study of 127 594 adults aged 35-70 years from 20 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. Diet was assessed at baseline using country-specific validated food frequency questionnaires. The glycaemic index and the glycaemic load were estimated on the basis of the intake of seven categories of carbohydrate-containing foods. Participants were categorised into quintiles of glycaemic index and glycaemic load. The primary outcome was incident type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Cox Frailty models with random intercepts for study centre were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs).
FINDINGS: During a median follow-up of 11·8 years (IQR 9·0-13·0), 7326 (5·7\%) incident cases of type 2 diabetes occurred. In multivariable adjusted analyses, a diet with a higher glycaemic index was significantly associated with a higher risk of diabetes (quintile 5 vs quintile 1; HR 1·15 [95\% CI 1·03-1·29]). Participants in the highest quintile of the glycaemic load had a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes compared with those in the lowest quintile (HR 1·21, 95\% CI 1·06-1·37). The glycaemic index was more strongly associated with diabetes among individuals with a higher BMI (quintile 5 vs quintile 1; HR 1·23 [95\% CI 1·08-1·41]) than those with a lower BMI (quintile 5 vs quintile 1; 1·10 [0·87-1·39]; p interaction=0·030).
INTERPRETATION: Diets with a high glycaemic index and a high glycaemic load were associated with a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes in a multinational cohort spanning five continents. Our findings suggest that consuming low glycaemic index and low glycaemic load diets might prevent the development of type 2 diabetes.

By fully accounting for LD across the genome, we develop a high-definition likelihood (HDL) method to improve precision in genetic correlation estimation. Compared to LDSC, HDL reduces the variance of genetic correlation estimates by about 60\%, equivalent to a 2.5-fold increase in sample size. We apply HDL and LDSC to estimate 435 genetic correlations among 30 behavioral and disease-related phenotypes measured in the UK Biobank (UKBB). In addition to 154 significant genetic correlations observed for both methods, HDL identified another 57 significant genetic correlations, compared to only another 2 significant genetic correlations identified by LDSC. HDL brings more power to genomic analyses and better reveals the underlying connections across human complex traits.},

Here, we present a benchmark study for different summary-statistics-based genetic correlation estimation methods through simulation and real data applications. We focus on two major technical challenges in estimating genetic correlation: marker dependency caused by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sample overlap between different studies. To assess the performance of different methods in the presence of these two challenges, we first conducted comprehensive simulations with diverse LD patterns and sample overlaps. Then we applied these methods to real GWAS summary statistics for a wide spectrum of complex traits. Based on these experiments, we conclude that methods relying on accurate LD estimation are less robust in real data applications due to the imprecision of LD obtained from reference panels. Our findings offer guidance on how to choose appropriate methods for genetic correlation estimation in post-GWAS analysis.},

This is achieved by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that includes all the possible decision thresholds from a diagnostic test result. In this brief report, we discuss the salient features of the ROC curve, as well as discuss and interpret the area under the ROC curve, and its utility in comparing two different tests or predictor variables of interest.},

However, the public health and clinical relevance of these discoveries is unclear. Evaluating the combined associations of genetic and environmental risk factors, particularly those that can be modified, will be critical in assessing the utility of genetic information for risk stratified prevention. In this commentary, using breast cancer as a model, we show that genetic information in combination with other risk factors can provide levels of risk stratification that could be useful for individual decision-making or population-based prevention programs. Our projections are theoretical and rely on a number of assumptions, including multiplicative models for the combined associations of the different risk factors, which need confirmation. Thus, analyses of epidemiological studies with high-quality risk factor information, as well as prevention trials, are needed to empirically assess the impact of genetics in risk stratified prevention.},

Here, in a collaboration between the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Complex Disease Working Group and the Polygenic Score (PGS) Catalog, we present the Polygenic Risk Score Reporting Standards (PRS-RS), in which we update the Genetic Risk Prediction Studies (GRIPS) Statement to reflect the present state of the field. Drawing on the input of experts in epidemiology, statistics, disease-specific applications, implementation and policy, this comprehensive reporting framework defines the minimal information that is needed to interpret and evaluate PRSs, especially with respect to downstream clinical applications. Items span detailed descriptions of study populations, statistical methods for the development and validation of PRSs and considerations for the potential limitations of these scores. In addition, we emphasize the need for data availability and transparency, and we encourage researchers to deposit and share PRSs through the PGS Catalog to facilitate reproducibility and comparative benchmarking. By providing these criteria in a structured format that builds on existing standards and ontologies, the use of this framework in publishing PRSs will facilitate translation into clinical care and progress towards defining best practice.},

Risk prediction typically includes risk factors such as age, sex, family history of disease and lifestyle (e.g. smoking status); however, in recent years, there has been increasing interest to include genomic information into risk models. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) aggregate the effects of many genetic variants across the human genome into a single score and have recently been shown to have predictive value for multiple common diseases. In this review, we summarize the potential use cases for seven common diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, obesity, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease) where PRS has or could have clinical utility. PRS analysis for these diseases frequently revolved around (i) risk prediction performance of a PRS alone and in combination with other non-genetic risk factors, (ii) estimation of lifetime risk trajectories, (iii) the independent information of PRS and family history of disease or monogenic mutations and (iv) estimation of the value of adding a PRS to specific clinical risk prediction scenarios. We summarize open questions regarding PRS usability, ancestry bias and transferability, emphasizing the need for the next wave of studies to focus on the implementation and health-economic value of PRS testing. In conclusion, it is becoming clear that PRS have value in disease risk prediction and there are multiple areas where this may have clinical utility.},

We show that incorporating PRS measurably improves prediction accuracy for most cancers, but the magnitude of this improvement varies substantially. We also demonstrate that stratifying on levels of PRS identifies significantly divergent 5-year risk trajectories after accounting for family history and modifiable risk factors. At the population level, the top 20\% of the PRS distribution accounts for 4.0\% to 30.3\% of incident cancer cases, exceeding the impact of many lifestyle-related factors.

Several studies suggest that the zinc transporter protein ZIP2 may play a relevant role in the immune system especially during zinc deficiency, while a polymorphism on the coding region of ZIP2 gene (Gln/Arg/Leu) has been associated with severe carotid artery disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of ZIP2 SNP on zinc and inflammatory status in 1090 elderly healthy free-living subjects enrolled in the ZincAge project and to assess the effect of zinc supplementation on zinc status, inflammatory mediators, and zinc transporter expression depending on ZIP2 genotype. ZIP2 Leu- (Arg43Arg) carriers showed enhanced IL-6, TNF-α, and RANTES plasma levels associated with decreased free cytosolic zinc in PBMCs and an upregulation of zinc transporters ZIP2, ZIP8, and Znt1. Moreover, Leu- subjects displayed significant decrement of inflammatory mediators such as MCP-1, TNF-α, and RANTES following zinc supplementation. In summary, this investigation provides new evidence on the effect of ZIP2 Gln/Arg/Leu polymorphism on proinflammatory mediators and zinc homeostasis in elderly population with a more pronounced anti-inflammatory effect of zinc supplementation in subjects carrying ZIP2 Leu- (Arg43Arg) genotype. These novel findings could be useful in identifying elderly subjects who may benefit of zinc intervention to decrease the inflammatory status and to prevent or delay the development of age-related diseases.},

	abstract = {Models with polygenic risk scores and clinical factors to predict risk of different cancers have been developed, but these models have been limited by the polygenic risk score–derivation methods and the incomplete selection of clinical variables.We used UK Biobank to train the best polygenic risk scores for 8 cancers (bladder, breast, colorectal, kidney, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers) and select relevant clinical variables from 733 baseline traits through extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Combining polygenic risk scores and clinical variables, we developed Cox proportional hazards models for risk prediction in these cancers.Our models achieved high prediction accuracy for 8 cancers, with areas under the curve ranging from 0.618 (95\% confidence interval = 0.581 to 0.655) for ovarian cancer to 0.831 (95\% confidence interval = 0.817 to 0.845) for lung cancer. Additionally, our models could identify individuals at a high risk for developing cancer. For example, the risk of breast cancer for individuals in the top 5\% score quantile was nearly 13 times greater than for individuals in the lowest 10\%. Furthermore, we observed a higher proportion of individuals with high polygenic risk scores in the early-onset group but a higher proportion of individuals at high clinical risk in the late-onset group.Our models demonstrated the potential to predict cancer risk and identify high-risk individuals with great generalizability to different cancers. Our findings suggested that the polygenic risk score model is more predictive for the cancer risk of early-onset patients than for late-onset patients, while the clinical risk model is more predictive for late-onset patients. Meanwhile, combining polygenic risk scores and clinical risk factors has overall better predictive performance than using polygenic risk scores or clinical risk factors alone.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
We evaluated the contribution of rice intake, a source of dietary arsenic, to cancer risk in a population of women with likely low arsenic exposure from drinking water and variable rice intake who participated in the California Teachers Study.

Methods:
Rice consumption was categorized into quartiles ({\textless}9.6, 9.7-15.6, 15.7-42.7, and ≥42.8 g/day). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) for incident cancer were estimated comparing rice consumption categories with bladder, breast, kidney, lung, and pancreatic cancer, with progressive adjustment for age, total calories, BMI, race, smoking status, physical activity, and cancer-specific covariates.

Results:
The number of breast, lung, pancreatic, bladder, and kidney cancer cases was 7,351; 1,100; 411; 344; and 238 respectively. The adjusted hazard ratios (95\% CI) comparing the highest versus lowest rice intake quartiles were 1.07 (1.00 - 1.15); 0.87 (0.72 – 1.04); 0.95 (0.66 – 1.37); 1.11 (0.81 – 1.52) and 1.07 (0.72 – 1.59) for breast, lung, pancreatic, bladder, and kidney cancers respectively. Results were consistent when rice was modeled as a continuous variable and in analyses stratified by smoking status.

Conclusion:
Rice consumption was not associated with risk of kidney, lung or pancreatic cancer, except maybe a small excess risk for breast cancer and a small non-significant excess risk for bladder cancer, comparing the highest versus lowest quartile of rice intake. Due to lower consumption patterns in this cohort, future studies should involve populations for which rice is a staple food and use of an arsenic biomarker.},

The model is used to project the distribution of absolute risk for the population of white women in the United States after adjustment for competing cause of mortality.Single nucleotide polymorphisms, family history, anthropometric factors, menstrual and/or reproductive factors, and lifestyle factors.Degree of stratification of absolute risk owing to nonmodifiable (SNPs, family history, height, and some components of menstrual and/or reproductive history) and modifiable factors (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], menopausal hormone therapy [MHT], alcohol, and smoking).The average absolute risk for a 30-year-old white woman in the United States developing invasive breast cancer by age 80 years is 11.3\%. A model that includes all risk factors provided a range of average absolute risk from 4.4\% to 23.5\% for women in the bottom and top deciles of the risk distribution, respectively. For women who were at the lowest and highest deciles of nonmodifiable risks, the 5th and 95th percentile range of the risk distribution associated with 4 modifiable factors was 2.9\% to 5.0\% and 15.5\% to 25.0\%, respectively. For women in the highest decile of risk owing to nonmodifiable factors, those who had low BMI, did not drink or smoke, and did not use MHT had risks comparable to an average woman in the general population.This model for absolute risk of breast cancer including SNPs can provide stratification for the population of white women in the United States. The model can also identify subsets of the population at an elevated risk that would benefit most from risk-reduction strategies based on altering modifiable factors. The effectiveness of this model for individual risk communication needs further investigation.},

	abstract = {Background and aims
The positive and negative health effects of dietary carbohydrates are of interest to both researchers and consumers.
Methods
International experts on carbohydrate research held a scientific summit in Stresa, Italy, in June 2013 to discuss controversies surrounding the utility of the glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL) and glycemic response (GR).
Results
The outcome was a scientific consensus statement which recognized the importance of postprandial glycemia in overall health, and the GI as a valid and reproducible method of classifying carbohydrate foods for this purpose. There was consensus that diets low in GI and GL were relevant to the prevention and management of diabetes and coronary heart disease, and probably obesity. Moderate to weak associations were observed for selected cancers. The group affirmed that diets low in GI and GL should always be considered in the context of diets otherwise understood as healthy, complementing additional ways of characterizing carbohydrate foods, such as fiber and whole grain content. Diets of low GI and GL were considered particularly important in individuals with insulin resistance.
Conclusions
Given the high prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes worldwide and the consistency of the scientific evidence reviewed, the expert panel confirmed an urgent need to communicate information on GI and GL to the general public and health professionals, through channels such as national dietary guidelines, food composition tables and food labels.},

We aimed to conduct a systematic literature review and dose-response meta-analysis of evidence from prospective cohorts.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in-process, Embase, CAB Abstracts, ISI Web of Science, and BIOSIS for prospective studies of GI, GL, and total carbohydrates in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes up to 17 July 2012. Data were extracted from 24 publications on 21 cohort studies. Studies using different exposure categories were combined on the same scale using linear and nonlinear dose-response trends. Summary relative risks (RRs) were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The summary RR was 1.08 per 5 GI units (95\% CI 1.02-1.15; P = 0.01), 1.03 per 20 GL units (95\% CI 1.00-1.05; P = 0.02), and 0.97 per 50 g/day of carbohydrate (95\% CI 0.90-1.06; P = 0.5). Dose-response trends were linear for GI and GL but more complex for total carbohydrate intake. Heterogeneity was high for all exposures (I(2) {\textgreater}50\%), partly accounted for by different covariate adjustment and length of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Included studies were observational and should be interpreted cautiously. However, our findings are consistent with protective effects of low dietary GI and GL, quantifying the range of intakes associated with lower risk. Future research could focus on the type of sugars and other carbohydrates associated with greatest risk.},

The present study aimed to estimate dietary GI and GL utilizing the updated GI tables with a large number of new, reliable GI values and assess their associations with metabolic syndrome among Korean adults.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from 3317 men and 6191 women for this cross-sectional study. Dietary intake was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome and its components were defined based on the harmonized criteria with Korean-specific cutoffs for waist circumference. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Compared with women in the lowest quintiles of energy-adjusted dietary GI and GL, women in the highest quintiles had significantly greater risks of metabolic syndrome (GI, OR = 1.56, 95\% CI = 1.18-2.06; GL, OR = 1.80, 95\% CI = 1.27-2.57), elevated blood pressure, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, both GI and GL), elevated triglycerides (GI only), elevated waist circumference, and elevated fasting glucose (GL only). Among men, no significant association was noted except for a higher risk of reduced HDL-C (OR = 1.59, 95\% CI = 1.01-2.29) in the highest quintile of energy-adjusted dietary GI than in the lowest quintile.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that dietary GI and GL are positively associated with metabolic syndrome risk among women, but not men, in Korea.},

	abstract = {The emerging role of chronic inflammation in the major degenerative diseases of modern society has stimulated research into the influence of nutrition and dietary patterns on inflammatory indices. Most human studies have correlated analyses of habitual dietary intake as determined by a food frequency questionnaire or 24-hour recall with systemic markers of inflammation like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). An occasional study also includes nutrition analysis of blood components. There have been several controlled interventions which evaluated the effect of a change in dietary pattern or of single foods on inflammatory markers in defined populations. Most studies reveal a modest effect of dietary composition on some inflammatory markers in free-living adults, although different markers do not vary in unison. Significant dietary influences have been established for glycemic index (GI) and load (GL), fiber, fatty acid composition, magnesium, carotenoids, and flavonoids. A traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern, which typically has a high ratio of monounsaturated (MUFA) to saturated (SFA) fats and ω-3 to ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFAs) and supplies an abundance of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains, has shown anti-inflammatory effects when compared with typical North American and Northern European dietary patterns in most observational and interventional studies and may become the diet of choice for diminishing chronic inflammation in clinical practice.},

This study assessed the prospective association between carbohydrate quantity and quality [dietary glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and added sugar, fiber, and whole-grain intake] during puberty, a potentially critical period for later disease, and low-grade inflammation in younger adulthood. The analysis was based on 205 participants (113 girls and 92 boys) from the DONALD (Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed) study with at least 2 3-d weighed dietary records during puberty (girls: 9-14 y, boys: 10-15 y) and blood samples in younger adulthood (18-36 y). Multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze the associations between carbohydrate nutrition and circulating concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory immune mediators [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL) 6, IL-18, and adiponectin]. A higher intake of carbohydrates during puberty (P-trend = 0.005), particularly from higher-GI food sources (P-trend = 0.01), was prospectively related to higher concentrations of IL-6 in younger adulthood, independently of baseline BMI and early life, socioeconomic, and other nutritional factors. Furthermore, a higher dietary GL (P-trend = 0.002) and a lower intake of whole grains (P-trend = 0.01) were independently associated with higher IL-6 concentrations in adults. Dietary GI and added sugar and fiber intakes were not independently associated with IL-6 (P-trend ≥ 0.09). Carbohydrate nutrition during puberty was not independently related to hs-CRP, IL-18, and adiponectin concentrations (all P-trend {\textgreater} 0.1). During puberty, a higher intake of carbohydrates from higher-GI food sources and lower whole-grain consumption prospectively predict greater IL-6 concentrations in young adulthood. These data support the hypothesis that diet during puberty influences later inflammation and metabolic dysfunction.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 1538 participants (51\% females), evaluated at 21 years of age as part of the EPITeen cohort. The GL of each individual was obtained from the assessment of their dietary intake by using a 86-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The evaluation included anthropometric measurements and a fasting blood sample was used to measure glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Insulin resistance was calculated based on the homeostasis model method (HOMA-IR). The association between the GL and the biochemical parameters was evaluated by linear regression models using β and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI), stratified by sex and adjusted for body mass index (BMI), energy and fiber intake, and self-perceived social class. No association was found between GL and the glucose metabolism parameters after adjustment. Regarding blood lipids, a positive association was found with LDL-C (β = 1.507, 95\% CI 0.454; 2.561 for females; β = 0.216, 95\% CI -0.587; 1.020 for males) and a negative association with HDL-C (β = -0.647, 95\% CI -1.112; -0.181 for females; β = -0.131, 95\% CI -0.422; 0.160 for males).

	abstract = {9029Background: Cancer clinical trials (CCTs) are vital to advancing treatment yet only 5-8\% of people with cancer ever participate, with even lower rates among underserved groups. Teaching oncologists in training how to communicate about CCTs may improve the frequency and quality of patient-oncologist communication about CCTs and increase participation. However, little is known about interest in or feasibility of such training during Hematology-Oncology (Hem-Onc) graduate medical education (GME) fellowships. We aimed to determine Hem-Onc fellowship programs’: 1) current practices, needs, and preferences for CCT-related communication training; and 2) the acceptability and feasibility of implementing a CCT communication skills workshop. Methods: We recruited and surveyed program directors (PDs) from Hem-Onc fellowship programs across the U.S. PDs were recruited via email through the ASCO program directors’ community, a publicly accessible list of ACGME Hematology-Oncology programs, and co-authors’ professional networks. Participants were compensated with a \$50 gift card. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and responses were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = “strongly disagree” to 5 = “strongly agree”). Results: 40 PDs were surveyed, most representing programs in the Northeast (30\%), Midwest (25.6\%), Southeast (20.5), and Southwest (15.4\%) U.S. Most were male (57\%) and identified as White (55\%), Asian (30\%), Black/African American (2.5\%) and Native American/Alaskan Native (2.5\%). PDs stated their institutions prioritize CCT accrual (M=4.58, SD=.78) and clinical research training (M=4.20, SD=.85). They reported their GME CCT curriculum least often addressed: (1) How to talk to patients about CCTs when none are available (27.5\%), and (2) How to help patients find CCTs at other institutions (17.5\%). PDs rated their fellows’ CCT knowledge as lowest in: (1) Provider-level barriers to enrolling/referring patients in CCTs (M=3.41, SD=.91) and (2) System-level barriers to patient accrual to CCTs (M=3.33, SD=.95). Fellows’ lowest-rated CCT communication skills areas were: (1) Making shared decisions with patients about CCT participation (M=3.54, SD=1.14) and (2) Patient-centered communication (M=3.50, SD=1.15). PDs were interested in a CCT communication workshop (‘yes’=67.5\%, ‘maybe’=32.5\%) and said such training was feasible (M=4.28, SD=.78) and useful (M=4.47, SD=.78). Training preferences were live presentations (M=3.9, SD=1.03) and program-tailored virtual workshops (M=3.9, SD=1.08). Conclusions: Hem-Onc fellowship program leaders expressed a need for training that improves fellows’ CCT knowledge and patient-centered communication skills. By highlighting current practices, challenges, and preferences, this study is an important step towards implementing and scaling communication skills training in GME programs.},

	abstract = {Although clinical trial research is required for the development of improved treatment strategies, very few cancer patients participate in these studies. The purpose of this study was to describe psychosocial barriers to clinical trial participation among oncologists and their cancer patients. A survey was distributed to all medical oncologists in Pennsylvania and a subset of their patients. Relevant background information and assessment of practical and psychosocial barriers to clinical trial participation were assessed. Among 137 oncologists and 170 patients who completed the surveys, 84\% of patients were aware of clinical trials, and oncologists and patients generally agreed that clinical trials are important to improving cancer treatment. However, oncologists and patients were more likely to consider clinical trials in advanced or refractory disease. When considering 7 potential barriers to clinical trials, random assignment and fear of receiving a placebo were ranked highly by both patients and oncologists. Patients identified fear of side effects as the greatest barrier to clinical trial participation, whereas oncologists ranked this psychosocial barrier as least important to their patients. Overall, the study found that although oncologists and patients are aware of clinical trials and have favorable attitudes toward them, psychosocial barriers exist for patients that may impact participation in clinical trials. Furthermore, important discrepancies exist between the perceptions of oncologists and those of patients regarding what the psychosocial barriers are. We concluded that characterizing oncologist and patient perceived barriers can help improve communication and decision making about clinical trials, such that participation may be optimized.},

These include expansions in data content and ancestral diversity as well as the addition of new features. We further present the PGS Catalog Calculator (pgsc\_calc, https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc\_calc), an open-source, scalable and portable pipeline to reproducibly calculate PGS that securely democratizes equitable PGS applications by implementing genetic ancestry estimation and score normalization using reference data. With the PGS Catalog \& calculator users can now quantify an individual’s genetic predisposition for hundreds of common diseases and clinically relevant traits.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ingestion of groundwater with high concentrations of inorganic arsenic has been linked to adverse health outcomes, including bladder cancer, however studies have not consistently observed any elevation in risk at lower concentrations. Genetic variability in the metabolism and clearance of arsenic is an important consideration in any investigation of its potential health risks. Therefore, we examined the association between genes thought to play a role in the metabolism of arsenic and bladder cancer.
METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GSTO-1, As3MT and MTHFR were genotyped using DNA from 219 bladder cancer cases and 273 controls participating in a case-control study in Southeastern Michigan and exposed to low to moderate ({\textless}50 μg/L) levels of arsenic in their drinking water. A time-weighted measure of arsenic exposure was constructed using measures from household water samples combined with past residential history, geocoded and merged with archived arsenic data predicted from multiple resources.
RESULTS: While no single SNP in As3MT was significantly associated with bladder cancer overall, several SNPs were associated with bladder cancer among those exposed to higher arsenic levels. Individuals with one or more copies of the C allele in rs11191439 (the Met287Thr polymorphism) had an elevated risk of bladder cancer (OR = 1.17; 95\% CI = 1.04-1.32 per 1 μg/L increase in average exposure). However, no association was observed between average arsenic exposure and bladder cancer among TT homozygotes in the same SNP. Bladder cancer cases were also 60\% less likely to be homozygotes for the A allele in rs1476413 in MTHFR compared to controls (OR = 0.40; 95\% CI = 0.18-0.88).
CONCLUSIONS: Variation in As3MT and MTHFR is associated with bladder cancer among those exposed to relatively low concentrations of inorganic arsenic. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Background. Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. The authors sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. Method. The authors describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. They start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the “decision curve.” The authors apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal. Conclusion. Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.},

However, most health effects studies focus on single agents or consider simple two-way interaction models, in part because we lack the statistical methodology to more realistically capture the complexity of mixed exposures. We introduce Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) as a new approach to study mixtures, in which the health outcome is regressed on a flexible function of the mixture (e.g. air pollution or toxic waste) components that is specified using a kernel function. In high-dimensional settings, a novel hierarchical variable selection approach is incorporated to identify important mixture components and account for the correlated structure of the mixture. Simulation studies demonstrate the success of BKMR in estimating the exposure-response function and in identifying the individual components of the mixture responsible for health effects. We demonstrate the features of the method through epidemiology and toxicology applications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The contribution of hereditary factors to the causation of sporadic cancer is unclear. Studies of twins make it possible to estimate the overall contribution of inherited genes to the development of malignant diseases.
METHODS: We combined data on 44,788 pairs of twins listed in the Swedish, Danish, and Finnish twin registries in order to assess the risks of cancer at 28 anatomical sites for the twins of persons with cancer. Statistical modeling was used to estimate the relative importance of heritable and environmental factors in causing cancer at 11 of those sites.
RESULTS: At least one cancer occurred in 10,803 persons among 9512 pairs of twins. An increased risk was found among the twins of affected persons for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancer. Statistically significant effects of heritable factors were observed for prostate cancer (42 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 50 percent), colorectal cancer (35 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 10 to 48 percent), and breast cancer (27 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 41 percent).
CONCLUSIONS: Inherited genetic factors make a minor contribution to susceptibility to most types of neoplasms. This finding indicates that the environment has the principal role in causing sporadic cancer. The relatively large effect of heritability in cancer at a few sites suggests major gaps in our knowledge of the genetics of cancer.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Estimates of familial cancer risk from population-based studies are essential components of cancer risk prediction.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate familial risk and heritability of cancer types in a large twin cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 80,309 monozygotic and 123,382 same-sex dizygotic twin individuals (N = 203,691) within the population-based registers of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Twins were followed up a median of 32 years between 1943 and 2010. There were 50,990 individuals who died of any cause, and 3804 who emigrated and were lost to follow-up.
EXPOSURES: Shared environmental and heritable risk factors among pairs of twins.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was incident cancer. Time-to-event analyses were used to estimate familial risk (risk of cancer in an individual given a twin's development of cancer) and heritability (proportion of variance in cancer risk due to interindividual genetic differences) with follow-up via cancer registries. Statistical models adjusted for age and follow-up time, and accounted for censoring and competing risk of death.
RESULTS: A total of 27,156 incident cancers were diagnosed in 23,980 individuals, translating to a cumulative incidence of 32\%. Cancer was diagnosed in both twins among 1383 monozygotic (2766 individuals) and 1933 dizygotic (2866 individuals) pairs. Of these, 38\% of monozygotic and 26\% of dizygotic pairs were diagnosed with the same cancer type. There was an excess cancer risk in twins whose co-twin was diagnosed with cancer, with estimated cumulative risks that were an absolute 5\% (95\% CI, 4\%-6\%) higher in dizygotic (37\%; 95\% CI, 36\%-38\%) and an absolute 14\% (95\% CI, 12\%-16\%) higher in monozygotic twins (46\%; 95\% CI, 44\%-48\%) whose twin also developed cancer compared with the cumulative risk in the overall cohort (32\%). For most cancer types, there were significant familial risks and the cumulative risks were higher in monozygotic than dizygotic twins. Heritability of cancer overall was 33\% (95\% CI, 30\%-37\%). Significant heritability was observed for the cancer types of skin melanoma (58\%; 95\% CI, 43\%-73\%), prostate (57\%; 95\% CI, 51\%-63\%), nonmelanoma skin (43\%; 95\% CI, 26\%-59\%), ovary (39\%; 95\% CI, 23\%-55\%), kidney (38\%; 95\% CI, 21\%-55\%), breast (31\%; 95\% CI, 11\%-51\%), and corpus uteri (27\%; 95\% CI, 11\%-43\%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this long-term follow-up study among Nordic twins, there was significant excess familial risk for cancer overall and for specific types of cancer, including prostate, melanoma, breast, ovary, and uterus. This information about hereditary risks of cancers may be helpful in patient education and cancer risk counseling.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of UBC and to review and interpret the current evidence on and impact of the related risk factors.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search in English was performed using PubMed. Relevant papers on the epidemiology of UBC were selected.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: UBC is the 7th most common cancer worldwide in men and the 17th most common cancer worldwide in women. Approximately 75\% of newly diagnosed UBCs are noninvasive. Each year, approximately 110 500 men and 70 000 women are diagnosed with new cases and 38 200 patients in the European Union and 17 000 US patients die from UBC. Smoking is the most common risk factor and accounts for approximately half of all UBCs. Occupational exposure to aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are other important risk factors. The impact of diet and environmental pollution is less evident. Increasing evidence suggests a significant influence of genetic predisposition on incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: UBC is a frequently occurring malignancy with a significant impact on public health and will remain so because of the high prevalence of smoking. The importance of primary prevention must be stressed, and smoking cessation programs need to be encouraged and supported.},

Phytoestrogens have anticarcinogenic potential, but they have also significant estrogenic properties. For an evaluation of the effect of phytoestrogens on breast cancer risk we reviewed the analytical epidemiological data. A total of 18 studies were included [1–18]. Up to now, there are 13 studies that have assessed the direct relation between the individual dietary intake of soy products and the risk of breast cancer [1–13]. Overall, results do not show protective effects, with the exception maybe for women who consume phytoestrogens at adolescence or at very high doses [5, 7, 8]. Only four of these 13 studies are prospective, and none of them found statistically significant breast cancer reductions. Four studies assessed urinary isoflavones excretion in relation to breast cancer [14–17]. Three of these are case control studies [14–16], where excretion was measured after breast cancer occurrence and thus seriously limiting causal interpretation of the results. The only prospective study with urinary measurements before breast cancer occurrence was done in a Dutch postmenopausal population and showed a non-significant breast cancer risk reduction for high excretion [17]. Three studies measured enterolactone (lignan): two case control studies reported a preventive effect on breast cancer risk [14, 18], but the only prospective study did not [17]. In conclusion, few prospective studies (n = 5) were done to assess the effects of phytoestrogens on breast cancer risk. None of them found protective effects. However, these prospective studies did not focus on ‘age at consumption’, which seems to be important based on results from dietary case control studies done so far.},

Using systematic review case studies from environmental science, we investigated the utility of GS in systematic reviews and in searches for grey literature. Our findings show that GS results contain moderate amounts of grey literature, with the majority found on average at page 80. We also found that, when searched for specifically, the majority of literature identified using Web of Science was also found using GS. However, our findings showed moderate/poor overlap in results when similar search strings were used in Web of Science and GS (10–67\%), and that GS missed some important literature in five of six case studies. Furthermore, a general GS search failed to find any grey literature from a case study that involved manual searching of organisations’ websites. If used in systematic reviews for grey literature, we recommend that searches of article titles focus on the first 200 to 300 results. We conclude that whilst Google Scholar can find much grey literature and specific, known studies, it should not be used alone for systematic review searches. Rather, it forms a powerful addition to other traditional search methods. In addition, we advocate the use of tools to transparently document and catalogue GS search results to maintain high levels of transparency and the ability to be updated, critical to systematic reviews.},

	abstract = {Background
The usefulness of Google Scholar (GS) as a bibliographic database for biomedical systematic review (SR) searching is a subject of current interest and debate in research circles. Recent research has suggested GS might even be used alone in SR searching. This assertion is challenged here by testing whether GS can locate all studies included in 21 previously published SRs. Second, it examines the recall of GS, taking into account the maximum number of items that can be viewed, and tests whether more complete searches created by an information specialist will improve recall compared to the searches used in the 21 published SRs.

Methods
The authors identified 21 biomedical SRs that had used GS and PubMed as information sources and reported their use of identical, reproducible search strategies in both databases. These search strategies were rerun in GS and PubMed, and analyzed as to their coverage and recall. Efforts were made to improve searches that underperformed in each database.

Results
GS’ overall coverage was higher than PubMed (98\% versus 91\%) and overall recall is higher in GS: 80\% of the references included in the 21 SRs were returned by the original searches in GS versus 68\% in PubMed. Only 72\% of the included references could be used as they were listed among the first 1,000 hits (the maximum number shown). Practical precision (the number of included references retrieved in the first 1,000, divided by 1,000) was on average 1.9\%, which is only slightly lower than in other published SRs. Improving searches with the lowest recall resulted in an increase in recall from 48\% to 66\% in GS and, in PubMed, from 60\% to 85\%.

Conclusions
Although its coverage and precision are acceptable, GS, because of its incomplete recall, should not be used as a single source in SR searching. A specialized, curated medical database such as PubMed provides experienced searchers with tools and functionality that help improve recall, and numerous options in order to optimize precision. Searches for SRs should be performed by experienced searchers creating searches that maximize recall for as many databases as deemed necessary by the search expert.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is debate over whether the glycaemic index of foods relates to chronic disease. We aimed to assess the associations between glycaemic index (GI) and glycaemic load (GL) and type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, diabetes-related cancers, and all-cause mortality.
METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of large cohorts (≥100 000 participants) identified from the Richard Doll Consortium. We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for cohorts that prospectively examined associations between GI or GL and chronic disease outcomes published from database inception to Aug 4, 2023. Full-article review and extraction of summary estimates data were conducted by three independent reviewers. Primary outcomes were incident type 2 diabetes, total cardiovascular disease (including mortality), diabetes-related cancers (ie, bladder, breast, colorectal, endometrial, hepatic, pancreatic, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and all-cause mortality. We assessed comparisons between the lowest and highest quantiles of GI and GL, adjusting for dietary factors, and pooling their most adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates using a fixed-effects model. We also assessed associations between diets high in fibre and whole grains and the four main outcomes. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023394689.
FINDINGS: From ten prospective large cohorts (six from the USA, one from Europe, two from Asia, and one international), we identified a total of 48 studies reporting associations between GI or GL and the outcomes of interest: 34 (71\%) on various cancers, nine (19\%) on cardiovascular disease, five (10\%) on type 2 diabetes, and three (6\%) on all-cause mortality. Consumption of high GI foods was associated with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes (RR 1·27 [95\% CI 1·21-1·34]; p{\textless}0·0001), total cardiovascular disease (1·15 [1·11-1·19]; p{\textless}0·0001), diabetes-related cancer (1·05 [1·02-1·08]; p=0·0010), and all-cause mortality (1·08 [1·05-1·12]; p{\textless}0·0001). Similar associations were seen between high GL and diabetes (RR 1·15 [95\% CI 1·09-1·21]; p{\textless}0·0001) and total cardiovascular disease (1·15 [1·10-1·20]; p{\textless}0·0001). Associations between diets high in fibre and whole grains and the four main outcomes were similar to those for low GI diets.
INTERPRETATION: Dietary recommendations to reduce GI and GL could have effects on health outcomes that are similar to outcomes of recommendations to increase intake of fibre and whole grain.

However, previous studies have been limited by focusing on a single type of dietary fiber and variations in outcome measures, which may not be effectively applied to provide dietary guidance for the general population. (2) Object: We summarized the meta-analysis of dietary fiber and cancer, and provided references for residents to prevent cancer. (3) Methods: Systematic search of relevant meta-analyses on the association between dietary fiber and cancer occurrence in PubMed, Web of Science and other databases was conducted from the time of database construction to February 2023. The method logical and evidence quality assessments were performed by applying the criteria in the “A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2” (AMSTAR2) scale and the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) Expert Report, respectively. (4) Results: Our analysis included 11 meta-analyses, and the AMSTAR 2 assessment revealed that the overall methodological quality was suboptimal, with two key items lacking sufficient information. Nonetheless, our findings indicate that a high intake of dietary fiber is associated with a reduced risk of several types of cancer, including esophageal, gastric, colon, rectal, colorectal adenoma, breast, endometrial, ovarian, renal cell, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. The majority of these associations were supported by a “probable” level of evidence. (5) Conclusions: Dietary fiber intake has different protective effects on different cancers.},

METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR) and summary data-based MR (SMR) analysis are used to explore the causal relationship between plasma lipids, lipid-lowering drug targets, and BC.
RESULTS: The result of MR suggested that per mg/dL higher levels of LDL-C (OR = 1.045, FDR = 0.023), HDL-C (OR = 1.079, FDR = 0.003), TC (OR = 1.043, FDR = 0.026), and APOA-I (OR = 1.085, FDR = 2.64E-04) were associated with increased BC risk, while TG was associated with reduced BC risk (OR = 0.926, FDR = 0.003). Per mg/dL higher levels of HDL-C (OR = 1.080, FDR = 0.011) and APOA-I (OR = 1.083, FDR = 0.002) were associated with increased ER+BC risk, while TG was associated with reduced ER+BC risk (OR = 0.909, FDR = 0.002). For every per 1 mg/dL decrease in LDL, HMGCR (OR: 0.839; FDR = 0.016), NPC1L1 (OR: 0.702; FDR = 0.004), and PCSK9 (OR: 0.916; FDR = 0.026) inhibition were associated with reduced BC risk, whereas CETP inhibition (OR: 1.194; FDR = 0.026) was associated with increased BC risk. For every per 1 mg/dL decrease in LDL, HMGCR (OR: 0.822; FDR = 0.023), NPC1L1 (OR: 0.633; FDR = 2.37E-03), and APOB inhibition (OR: 0.816; FDR = 1.98E-03) were associated with decreased ER-BC risk, while CETP inhibition (OR: 1.465; FDR = 0.011) was associated with increased ER-BC risk. SMR analysis indicated that HMGCR was associated with increased BC risk (OR: 1.112; p = 0.044).
CONCLUSION: Lipids are associated with the BC risk, and lipid-lowering drugs targets HMGCR, NPC1L1, PCSK9, and APOB may be effective strategies for preventing BC. However, lipid-lowering drugs target CETP may potentially increase BC risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses.
DESIGN: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision.
RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

These metabolites are generated throughout  the body, either enzymatically or from oxidative stress, and are detectable in  peripheral circulation. We previously reported that circulating  27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), an endogenous selective estrogen receptor  modulator, may be a risk factor for colorectal adenomas. Here, in addition to  27-OHC, we report on four other circulating oxysterols: 25-hydroxycholesterol,  24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 7ɑ-hydroxycholesterol, and 4β-hydroxycholesterol.  Oxysterol concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography/mass  spectrometry from fasting plasma collected at baseline from 1,246 participants of  the Vitamin D/Calcium Polyp Prevention Study, a multicenter adenoma  chemoprevention trial. To evaluate multiple oxysterols simultaneously, we used  both log-linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression models  developed for analyses of complex mixtures adjusted for potential confounding  factors. Higher circulating 7ɑ-hydroxycholesterol was associated with higher  adenoma risk (Bayesian kernel machine regression-based multivariable-adjusted  risk ratios (RR; for the 75th vs. 25th percentile, 1.22; 95\% credible interval,  CI, 1.04-1.42). In contrast, higher circulating 4β-hydroxycholesterol was  associated with lower risk of these polyps (RR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.99). The  positive association with advanced adenoma risk that we previously reported for  circulating 27-OHC persisted when controlling for other oxysterols (RR, 1.26; 95\%  CI, 0.98-1.62), including among those with advanced adenomas at baseline (RR,  1.75; 95\% CI, 1.01-3.06). Prevention Relevance: Circulating concentrations of  multiple oxysterols measured at the time of an initial colorectal adenoma  diagnosis may be risk factors for subsequent incidence of these lesions.

We systematically analyzed evidence for precision treatments  for GCK-related hyperglycemia, HNF1A-, HNF4A- and HNF1B-diabetes, and  mitochondrial diabetes (MD) due to m.3243 A {\textgreater} G variant, 6q24-transient neonatal  diabetes mellitus (TND) and SLC19A2-diabetes. METHODS: The search of PubMed,  MEDLINE, and Embase for individual and group level data for glycemic outcomes  using inclusion (English, original articles written after 1992) and exclusion  (VUS, multiple diabetes types, absent/aggregated treatment effect measures)  criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using NHLBI study-quality assessment  tools. Data extracted from Covidence were summarized and presented as descriptive  statistics in tables and text. RESULTS: There are 146 studies included, with only  six being experimental studies. For GCK-related hyperglycemia, the six studies  (35 individuals) assessing therapy discontinuation show no HbA1c deterioration. A  randomized trial (18 individuals per group) shows that sulfonylureas (SU) were  more effective in HNF1A-diabetes than in type 2 diabetes. Cohort and case studies  support SU's effectiveness in lowering HbA1c. Two cross-over trials (each with  15-16 individuals) suggest glinides and GLP-1 receptor agonists might be used in  place of SU. Evidence for HNF4A-diabetes is limited. Most reported patients with  HNF1B-diabetes (N = 293) and MD (N = 233) are on insulin without treatment  studies. Limited data support oral agents after relapse in 6q24-TND and for  thiamine improving glycemic control and reducing/eliminating insulin requirement  in SLC19A2-diabetes. CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence, and with moderate or  serious risk of bias, to guide monogenic diabetes treatment.

This  review evaluated intervention characteristics to inform the implementation of GDM  prevention interventions. METHODS: Ovid, MEDLINE/PubMed, and EMBASE databases  were searched. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR)  framework was used to examine intervention characteristics (who, what, when,  where, and how). Subgroup analysis was performed by intervention characteristics.  RESULTS: 116 studies involving 40,940 participants are included. Group-based  physical activity interventions (RR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.46, 0.95) reduce the incidence  of GDM compared with individual or mixed (individual and group) delivery format  (subgroup p-value = 0.04).

No other  intervention characteristics impact the effectiveness of all other interventions.  CONCLUSIONS: Dietary, physical activity, diet plus physical activity, metformin,  and myoinositol interventions reduce the incidence of GDM compared with control  interventions. Group and healthcare facility-based physical activity  interventions show better effectiveness in preventing GDM than individual and  community-based interventions. Other intervention characteristics (e.g.  utilization of e-health) don't impact the effectiveness of lifestyle  interventions, and thus, interventions may require consideration of the local  context.},

METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed and EMBASE databases  (6/14/2022) assessing 10 years of original research examining relationships  between autoantibodies and heterogeneity before, at, after diagnosis, and in  response to disease-modifying therapies in individuals at-risk or within 1 year  of T1D diagnosis. A critical appraisal checklist tool for cohort studies was  modified and used for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Here we show that 152  studies that met extraction criteria most commonly characterized heterogeneity  before diagnosis (91/152). Autoantibody type/target was most frequently examined,  followed by autoantibody number. Recurring themes included correlations of  autoantibody number, type, and titers with progression, differing phenotypes  based on order of autoantibody seroconversion, and interactions with age and  genetics. Only 44\% specifically described autoantibody assay standardization  program participation. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence most strongly supports the  application of autoantibody features to more precisely define T1D before  diagnosis. Our findings support continued use of pre-clinical staging paradigms  based on autoantibody number and suggest that additional autoantibody features,  particularly in relation to age and genetic risk, could offer more precise  stratification. To improve reproducibility and applicability of  autoantibody-based precision medicine in T1D, we propose a methods checklist for  islet autoantibody-based manuscripts which includes use of precision medicine  MeSH terms and participation in autoantibody standardization workshops.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precision medicine has the potential to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction in individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS:  We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies to  identify potentially novel prognostic factors that may improve CVD risk  prediction in T2D. Out of 9380 studies identified, 416 studies met inclusion  criteria. Outcomes were reported for 321 biomarker studies, 48 genetic marker  studies, and 47 risk score/model studies. RESULTS: Out of all evaluated  biomarkers, only 13 showed improvement in prediction performance. Results of  pooled meta-analyses, non-pooled analyses, and assessments of improvement in  prediction performance and risk of bias, yielded the highest predictive utility  for N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (high-evidence),  troponin-T (TnT) (moderate-evidence), triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index  (moderate-evidence), Genetic Risk Score for Coronary Heart Disease (GRS-CHD)  (moderate-evidence); moderate predictive utility for coronary computed tomography  angiography (low-evidence), single-photon emission computed tomography  (low-evidence), pulse wave velocity (moderate-evidence); and low predictive  utility for C-reactive protein (moderate-evidence), coronary artery calcium score  (low-evidence), galectin-3 (low-evidence), troponin-I (low-evidence), carotid  plaque (low-evidence), and growth differentiation factor-15 (low-evidence). Risk  scores showed modest discrimination, with lower performance in populations  different from the original development cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high  interest in this topic, very few studies conducted rigorous analyses to  demonstrate incremental predictive utility beyond established CVD risk factors  for T2D. The most promising markers identified were NT-proBNP, TnT, TyG and  GRS-CHD, with the highest strength of evidence for NT-proBNP. Further research is  needed to determine their clinical utility in risk stratification and management  of CVD in T2D.},

METHODS: This review  included studies published in English language from January 1st, 1990, through  September 30th, 2021, that focused on the above outcomes of interest with respect  to sociodemographic factors, lifestyle and behavioral characteristics,  traditional clinical traits, and 'omics biomarkers in the mothers and offspring  during the perinatal/postpartum periods and across the lifecourse. Studies that  did not report associations of prognostic factors with outcomes of interest among  GDM-exposed women or children were excluded. RESULTS: Here, we identified 109  publications comprising 98 observational studies and 11 randomized-controlled  trials. Findings indicate that GDM severity, maternal obesity, race/ethnicity,  and unhealthy diet and physical activity levels predict T2D and CVD in women, and  greater cardiometabolic risk in offspring. However, using the Diabetes Canada  2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines for studies, the level of evidence was low due  to potential for confounding, reverse causation, and selection biases.  CONCLUSIONS: GDM pregnancies with greater severity, as well as those accompanied  by maternal obesity, unhealthy diet, and low physical activity, as well as cases  that occur among women who identify as racial/ethnic minorities are associated  with worse cardiometabolic prognosis in mothers and offspring. However, given the  low quality of evidence, prospective studies with detailed covariate data  collection and high fidelity of follow-up are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perinatal outcomes vary for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The precise factors beyond glycemic status that may refine GDM diagnosis  remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of potential  precision markers for GDM. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed  in PubMed and EMBASE from inception to March 2022 for studies comparing perinatal  outcomes among women with GDM. We searched for precision markers in the following  categories: maternal anthropometrics, clinical/sociocultural factors,  non-glycemic biochemical markers, genetics/genomics or other -omics, and fetal  biometry. We conducted post-hoc meta-analyses of a subset of studies with data on  the association of maternal body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) with offspring  macrosomia or large-for-gestational age (LGA). RESULTS: A total of 5905  titles/abstracts were screened, 775 full-texts reviewed, and 137 studies  synthesized. Maternal anthropometrics were the most frequent risk marker.  Meta-analysis demonstrated that women with GDM and overweight/obesity vs. GDM  with normal range BMI are at higher risk of offspring macrosomia (13 studies  [n = 28,763]; odds ratio [OR] 2.65; 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.91, 3.68), and  LGA (10 studies [n = 20,070]; OR 2.23; 95\% CI 2.00, 2.49). Lipids and insulin  resistance/secretion indices were the most studied non-glycemic biochemical  markers, with increased triglycerides and insulin resistance generally associated  with greater risk of offspring macrosomia or LGA. Studies evaluating other  markers had inconsistent findings as to whether they could be used as precision  markers. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal overweight/obesity is associated with greater risk  of offspring macrosomia or LGA in women with GDM. Pregnancy insulin resistance or  hypertriglyceridemia may be useful in GDM risk stratification. Future studies  examining non-glycemic biochemical, genetic, other -omic, or sociocultural  precision markers among women with GDM are warranted.},

We undertook a systematic review to determine whether strategies to subclassify  type 2 diabetes were associated with high quality evidence, reproducible results  and improved outcomes for patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for  publications that used 'simple subclassification' approaches using simple  categorisation of clinical characteristics, or 'complex subclassification'  approaches which used machine learning or 'omics approaches in people with  established type 2 diabetes. We excluded other diabetes subtypes and those  predicting incident type 2 diabetes. We assessed quality, reproducibility and  clinical relevance of extracted full-text articles and qualitatively synthesised  a summary of subclassification approaches. RESULTS: Here we show data from 51  studies that demonstrate many simple stratification approaches, but none have  been replicated and many are not associated with meaningful clinical outcomes.  Complex stratification was reviewed in 62 studies and produced reproducible  subtypes of type 2 diabetes that are associated with outcomes. Both approaches  require a higher grade of evidence but support the premise that type 2 diabetes  can be subclassified into clinically meaningful subtypes. CONCLUSION: Critical  next steps toward clinical implementation are to test whether subtypes exist in  more diverse ancestries and whether tailoring interventions to subtypes will  improve outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 1 in 7 pregnancies globally. It is associated with short- and long-term risks for both  mother and baby. Therefore, optimizing treatment to effectively treat the  condition has wide-ranging beneficial effects. However, despite the known  heterogeneity in GDM, treatment guidelines and approaches are generally  standardized. We hypothesized that a precision medicine approach could be a tool  for risk-stratification of women to streamline successful GDM management. With  the relatively short timeframe available to treat GDM, commencing effective  therapy earlier, with more rapid normalization of hyperglycaemia, could have  benefits for both mother and fetus. METHODS: We conducted two systematic reviews,  to identify precision markers that may predict effective lifestyle and  pharmacological interventions. RESULTS: There was a paucity of studies examining  precision lifestyle-based interventions for GDM highlighting the pressing need  for further research in this area. We found a number of precision markers  identified from routine clinical measures that may enable earlier identification  of those requiring escalation of pharmacological therapy (to metformin,  sulphonylureas or insulin). This included previous history of GDM, Body Mass  Index and blood glucose concentrations at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical  measurements at diagnosis could potentially be used as precision markers in the  treatment of GDM. Whether there are other sensitive markers that could be  identified using more complex individual-level data, such as omics, and if these  can feasibly be implemented in clinical practice remains unknown.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. Prevention efforts have focused on immune  modulation and supporting beta cell health before or around diagnosis; however,  heterogeneity in disease progression and therapy response has limited translation  to clinical practice, highlighting the need for precision medicine approaches to  T1D disease modification. METHODS: To understand the state of knowledge in this  area, we performed a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials with ≥50  participants cataloged in PubMed or Embase from the past 25 years testing T1D  disease-modifying therapies and/or identifying features linked to treatment  response, analyzing bias using a Cochrane-risk-of-bias instrument. RESULTS: We  identify and summarize 75 manuscripts, 15 describing 11 prevention trials for  individuals with increased risk for T1D, and 60 describing treatments aimed at  preventing beta cell loss at disease onset. Seventeen interventions, mostly  immunotherapies, show benefit compared to placebo (only two prior to T1D onset).  Fifty-seven studies employ precision analyses to assess features linked to  treatment response. Age, beta cell function measures, and immune phenotypes are  most frequently tested. However, analyses are typically not prespecified, with  inconsistent methods of reporting, and tend to report positive findings.  CONCLUSIONS: While the quality of prevention and intervention trials is overall  high, the low quality of precision analyses makes it difficult to draw meaningful  conclusions that inform clinical practice. To facilitate precision medicine  approaches to T1D prevention, considerations for future precision studies include  the incorporation of uniform outcome measures, reproducible biomarkers, and  prespecified, fully powered precision analyses into future trial design.},

Robust evidence of such treatment effect  heterogeneity could support more individualized clinical decisions on optimal  type 2 diabetes therapy. METHODS: We performed a pre-registered systematic review  of meta-analysis studies, randomized control trials, and observational studies  evaluating clinical and biological features associated with heterogenous  treatment effects for SGLT2-inhibitor and GLP1-receptor agonist therapies,  considering glycaemic, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes. After screening 5,686  studies, we included 101 studies of SGLT2-inhibitors and 75 studies of  GLP1-receptor agonists in the final systematic review. RESULTS: Here we show that  the majority of included papers have methodological limitations precluding robust  assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity. For SGLT2-inhibitors, multiple  observational studies suggest lower renal function as a predictor of lesser  glycaemic response, while markers of reduced insulin secretion predict lesser  glycaemic response with GLP1-receptor agonists. For both therapies, multiple  post-hoc analyses of randomized control trials (including trial meta-analysis)  identify minimal clinically relevant treatment effect heterogeneity for  cardiovascular and renal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence on treatment  effect heterogeneity for SGLT2-inhibitor and GLP1-receptor agonist therapies is  limited, likely reflecting the methodological limitations of published studies.

This  study aimed to systematically evaluate the participant characteristics associated  with responses to interventions in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)  prevention. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Pubmed to identify  lifestyle (diet, physical activity, or both), metformin, myoinositol/inositol and  probiotics interventions of GDM prevention published up to May 24, 2022. RESULTS:  From 10347 studies, 116 studies (n = 40940 women) are included. Physical activity  results in greater GDM reduction in participants with a normal body mass index  (BMI) at baseline compared to obese BMI (risk ratio, 95\% confidence interval:  0.06 [0.03, 0.14] vs 0.68 [0.26, 1.60]). Combined diet and physical activity  interventions result in greater GDM reduction in participants without polycystic  ovary syndrome (PCOS) than those with PCOS (0.62 [0.47, 0.82] vs 1.12  [0.78-1.61]) and in those without a history of GDM than those with unspecified  GDM history (0.62 [0.47, 0.81] vs 0.85 [0.76, 0.95]). Metformin interventions are  more effective in participants with PCOS than those with unspecified status (0.38  [0.19, 0.74] vs 0.59 [0.25, 1.43]), or when commenced preconception than during  pregnancy (0.21 [0.11, 0.40] vs 1.15 [0.86-1.55]). Parity, history of having a  large-for-gestational-age infant or family history of diabetes have no effect on  intervention responses. CONCLUSIONS: GDM prevention through metformin or  lifestyle differs according to some individual characteristics.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The greatest change in the treatment of people living with type 1 diabetes in the last decade has been the explosion of technology assisting in all  aspects of diabetes therapy, from glucose monitoring to insulin delivery and  decision making. As such, the aim of our systematic review was to assess the  utility of these technologies as well as identify any precision medicine-directed  findings to personalize care. METHODS: Screening of 835 peer-reviewed articles  was followed by systematic review of 70 of them (focusing on randomized trials  and extension studies with ≥50 participants from the past 10 years). RESULTS: We  find that novel technologies, ranging from continuous glucose monitoring systems,  insulin pumps and decision support tools to the most advanced hybrid closed loop  systems, improve important measures like HbA1c, time in range, and glycemic  variability, while reducing hypoglycemia risk. Several studies included  person-reported outcomes, allowing assessment of the burden or benefit of the  technology in the lives of those with type 1 diabetes, demonstrating positive  results or, at a minimum, no increase in self-care burden compared with standard  care. Important limitations of the trials to date are their small size, the  scarcity of pre-planned or powered analyses in sub-populations such as children,  racial/ethnic minorities, people with advanced complications, and variations in  baseline glycemic levels. In addition, confounders including education with  device initiation, concomitant behavioral modifications, and frequent contact  with the healthcare team are rarely described in enough detail to assess their  impact. CONCLUSIONS: Our review highlights the potential of technology in the  treatment of people living with type 1 diabetes and provides suggestions for  optimization of outcomes and areas of further study for precision  medicine-directed technology use in type 1 diabetes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monogenic insulin resistance (IR) includes lipodystrophy and disorders of insulin signalling. We sought to assess the effects of interventions  in monogenic IR, stratified by genetic aetiology. METHODS: Systematic review  using PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase (1 January 1987 to 23 June 2021). Studies  reporting individual-level effects of pharmacologic and/or surgical interventions  in monogenic IR were eligible. Individual data were extracted and duplicates were  removed. Outcomes were analysed for each gene and intervention, and in aggregate  for partial, generalised and all lipodystrophy. RESULTS: 10 non-randomised  experimental studies, 8 case series, and 23 case reports meet inclusion criteria,  all rated as having moderate or serious risk of bias. Metreleptin use is  associated with the lowering of triglycerides and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in all  lipodystrophy (n = 111), partial (n = 71) and generalised lipodystrophy (n = 41),  and in LMNA, PPARG, AGPAT2 or BSCL2 subgroups (n = 72,13,21 and 21 respectively).  Body Mass Index (BMI) is lowered in partial and generalised lipodystrophy, and in  LMNA or BSCL2, but not PPARG or AGPAT2 subgroups. Thiazolidinediones are  associated with improved HbA1c and triglycerides in all lipodystrophy (n = 13),  improved HbA1c in PPARG (n = 5), and improved triglycerides in LMNA (n = 7). In  INSR-related IR, rhIGF-1, alone or with IGFBP3, is associated with improved HbA1c  (n = 17). The small size or absence of other genotype-treatment combinations  preclude firm conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence guiding genotype-specific  treatment of monogenic IR is of low to very low quality. Metreleptin and  Thiazolidinediones appear to improve metabolic markers in lipodystrophy, and  rhIGF-1 appears to lower HbA1c in INSR-related IR. For other interventions, there  is insufficient evidence to assess efficacy and risks in aggregated lipodystrophy  or genetic subgroups.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The first-line approach for childhood obesity is lifestyle intervention (LI); however, success varies. This study aimed first to identify  distinct subgroups of response in children living with overweight and obesity and  second to elucidate predictors for subclusters. METHODS: Based on the obesity  patient follow-up registry the APV (Adipositas-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation)  initiative, a total of 12,453 children and adolescents (median age: 11.5 [IQR:  9.7-13.2] years; BMI z score [BMIz]: 2.06 [IQR: 1.79-2.34]; 52.6\% girls) living  with overweight/obesity and participating in outpatient LI were studied.  Longitudinal k-means clustering was used to identify individual BMIz response  curve for up to 2 years after treatment initiation. Multinomial logistic  regression was used to elucidate predictors for cluster membership. RESULTS: A  total of 36.3\% of children and adolescents experienced "no BMIz loss." The  largest subcluster (44.8\%) achieved "moderate BMIz loss," with an average  delta-BMIz of -0.23 (IQR: -0.33 to -0.14) at study end. A total of 18.9\% had a  "pronounced BMIz loss" up to -0.61 (IQR: -0.76 to -0.49). Younger age and lower  BMIz at LI initiation, larger initial BMIz loss, and less social deprivation were  linked with higher likelihood for moderate or pronounced BMIz loss compared with  the no BMIz loss cluster (all p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the  importance of patient-tailored intervention and earlier treatment escalation in  high-risk individuals who have little chance of success.},

In this study, we  assessed gender and race/ethnicity representation in editorial board positions in  hematology/oncology journals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Editorial leadership board  members from 60 major journals in hematology and oncology were reviewed; 54  journals were included in the final analysis. Gender and race/ethnicity were  determined based on publicly available data for Editor-in-Chief (EiC) and  Second-in-Command (SiC) (including deputy, senior, or associate editors).  Descriptive statistics and chi-squared were estimated. In the second phase of the  study, editors were emailed a 4-item survey to self-identify their demographics.  RESULTS: Out of 793 editorial board members, 72.6\% were men and 27.4\% were women.  Editorial leadership were non-Hispanic white (71.1\%) with Asian editorial board  members representing the second largest majority at 22.5\%. Women comprised only  15.9\% of the EiC positions (90\% White and 10\% Asian). Women were about half as  likely to be in the EiC position compared with men [pOR 0.47 (95\% CI, 0.23-0.95,  P = .03)]. Women represented 28.3\% of SiC editorial positions. Surgical oncology  had the lowest female representation at 2.3\%. CONCLUSION: Women and minorities  are significantly underrepresented in leadership roles on Editorial Boards in  hematology/oncology journals. Importantly, the representation of minority women  physicians in EiC positions is at an inexorable zero.},

Internal medicine residency  curricula are lacking training for cancer survivorship and SCPs. Here, we aimed  to assess the awareness and utilization of SCPs in medicine trainees. METHODS: A  pilot survey investigating awareness and experience with SCPs was distributed  among internal medicine trainees in an outpatient setting. Participants were  stratified by program type (transitional and categorical) and year of training.  Differences in proportions were tested with parametric and non-parametric tests.  RESULTS: All thirty-seven participants who were administered a survey responded;  32.4\% and 67.6\% were transitional and categorical trainees, respectively; 54\%  were PGY-1, 21.6\% PGY-2, and 24.3\% PGY-3. None of the trainees reported following  a SCP for cancer-free patients nor plans to use SCP as a source to obtain  information. Up to 78.3\% and 92.6\% of participants reported that they were not  taught about SCPs during their residency or medical school, respectively. The  most frequent barriers to discuss cancer history and SCP with their patients  were: insufficient or lack of information about SCPs (83.8\%), patients'  information as a source deemed "unreliable" (81.1\%), and uncertainty if the  patient has SCP (81.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness and use of cancer SCPs among  internal medicine trainees is limited, furthermore, a sizeable proportion  reported not having accessed or received any training for SCPs. Efforts intended  to facilitate SCP use and educate trainees about cancer survivorship may prove to  be an effective strategy to increase the quality of care to cancer survivors.},

	abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Excess adiposity is differentially associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease in men and women, according to observational  studies. Causal inference studies largely assume a linear relationship between  BMI and cardiometabolic outcomes, which may not be the case. In this study, we  investigated the shapes of the causal relationships between BMI and  cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors. We further investigated sex  differences within the causal framework. METHODS: To assess causal relationships  between BMI and the outcomes, we used two-stage least-squares Mendelian  randomisation (MR), with a polygenic risk score for BMI as the instrumental  variable. To elucidate the shapes of the causal relationships, we used a  non-linear MR fractional polynomial method, and used piecewise MR to investigate  threshold relationships and confirm the shapes. RESULTS: BMI was associated with  type 2 diabetes (OR 3.10; 95\% CI 2.73, 3.53), hypertension (OR 1.53; 95\% CI 1.44,  1.62) and coronary artery disease (OR 1.20; 95\% CI 1.08, 1.33), but not chronic  kidney disease (OR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.67, 1.72) or stroke (OR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.92,  1.28). The data suggest that these relationships are non-linear. For  cardiometabolic risk factors, BMI was positively associated with glucose,  HbA(1c), triacylglycerol levels and both systolic and diastolic BP. BMI had an  inverse causal relationship with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and  HDL-cholesterol. The data suggest a non-linear causal relationship between BMI  and BP and other biomarkers (p{\textless}0.001) except lipoprotein A. The piecewise MR  results were consistent with the fractional polynomial results. The causal effect  of BMI on coronary artery disease, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was  different in men and women, but this sex difference was only significant for  LDL-cholesterol after controlling for multiple testing (p{\textless}0.001). Further, the  causal effect of BMI on coronary artery disease varied by menopause status in  women. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We describe the shapes of causal effects of  BMI on cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors, and report sex differences in  the causal effects of BMI on LDL-cholesterol. We found evidence of non-linearity  in the causal effect of BMI on diseases and risk factor biomarkers. Reducing  excess adiposity is highly beneficial for health, but there is greater need to  consider biological sex in the management of adiposity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal adverse effects occur in 20-30\% of patients with metformin-treated type 2 diabetes, leading to premature discontinuation in 5-10\%  of the cases. Gastrointestinal intolerance may reflect localized high  concentrations of metformin in the gut. We hypothesized that reduced transport of  metformin via the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) and organic cation  transporter 1 (OCT1) could increase the risk of severe gastrointestinal adverse  effects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 286 severe  metformin-intolerant and 1,128 metformin-tolerant individuals from the IMI DIRECT  (Innovative Medicines Initiative: DIabetes REsearCh on patient straTification)  consortium. We assessed the association of patient characteristics, concomitant  medication, and the burden of mutations in the SLC29A4 and SLC22A1 genes on odds  of intolerance. RESULTS: Women (P {\textless} 0.001) and older people (P {\textless} 0.001) were more  likely to develop metformin intolerance. Concomitant use of  transporter-inhibiting drugs increased the odds of intolerance (odds ratio [OR]  1.72, P {\textless} 0.001). In an adjusted logistic regression model, the G allele at  rs3889348 (SLC29A4) was associated with gastrointestinal intolerance (OR 1.34, P  = 0.005). rs3889348 is the top cis-expression quantitative trait locus for  SLC29A4 in gut tissue where carriers of the G allele had reduced expression.  Homozygous carriers of the G allele treated with transporter-inhibiting drugs had  more than three times higher odds of intolerance compared with carriers of no G  allele and not treated with inhibiting drugs (OR 3.23, P {\textless} 0.001). Use of a  genetic risk score derived from rs3889348 and SLC22A1 variants found that the  odds of intolerance were more than twice as high in individuals who carry three  or more risk alleles compared with those carrying none (OR 2.15, P = 0.01).

	abstract = {A significant association between ingested arsenic and bladder cancer has been reported in an arseniasis-endemic area in southwestern Taiwan, where many households share only a few wells in their villages. In another arseniasis-endemic area in northeastern Taiwan, each household has its own well for obtaining drinking water. In 1991–1994, the authors examined risk of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) in relation to ingested arsenic in a cohort of 8,102 residents in northeastern Taiwan. Estimation of each study subject's individual exposure to inorganic arsenic was based on the arsenic concentration in his or her own well water, which was determined by hydride generation combined with atomic absorption spectrometry. Information on duration of consumption of the well water was obtained through standardized questionnaire interviews. The occurrence of urinary tract cancers was ascertained by follow-up interview and by data linkage with community hospital records, the national death certification profile, and the cancer registry profile. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate multivariate-adjusted relative risks and 95\% confidence intervals. There was a significantly increased incidence of urinary cancers for the study cohort compared with the general population in Taiwan (standardized incidence ratio = 2.05; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.22, 3.24). A significant dose-response relation between risk of cancers of the urinary organs, especially TCC, and indices of arsenic exposure was observed after adjustment for age, sex, and cigarette smoking. The multivariate-adjusted relative risks of developing TCC were 1.9, 8.2, and 15.3 for arsenic concentrations of 10.1–50.0, 50.1–100, and \&gt;100 µg/liter, respectively, compared with the referent level of ≤10.0 µg/liter.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms underlying how arsenic methylation capacity affects bladder cancer (BC) are still unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of polymorphisms of arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT) on BC risk. We conducted a hospital-based study and enrolled 216 BC and 648 healthy controls from 2007 to 2011. Urinary arsenic profiles were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry. The gene polymorphisms of AS3MT were identified using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform with iPLEX Gold chemistry. Inefficient arsenic methylation capacity (high monomethylarsonic acid percentage [MMA\%] and low dimethylarsinic acid percentage [DMA\%]) was associated with increased risk of BC in a dose-response relationship. AS3MT rs11191438 (C \&gt; G) G/G genotype, AS3MT rs10748835 (A \&gt; G) G/G genotype, and AS3MT rs1046778 (C \&gt; T) T/T genotype were found to be related to BC risk, where the odds ratio (OR) (95\% CI) was 0.50 (0.31–0.82), 0.49 (0.30–0.79), and 0.54 (0.36–0.80), respectively. The combination of AS3MT haplotype 2 (AS3MT rs11191453, rs11191454, rs10748835, and rs1046778)’s high-risk haplotype (C-G-A-C, T-A-A-C, and T-G-G-T) was significantly associated with increased risk of BC. Among controls, only 3 of the 9 candidate genotypes evaluated, rs1119438 C/C, rs10748835 A/A and rs1046778 C/C, were associated with significantly higher MMA\% compared with the other genotypes. No other genotypes or haplotypes were related to arsenic methylation capacity. High MMA\%, low DMA\% and AS3MT rs1046778 C/C + C/T genotype predicted a significantly higher risk of BC according to stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses. AS3MT gene polymorphisms and arsenic methylation capacity appeared to affect BC risk independently.},

	abstract = {Context
Bladder cancer (BC) represents a significant health problem due to the potential morbidity and mortality associated with disease burden, which has remained largely unaltered over time.
Objective
To provide an expert collaborative review and describe the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of BC and to evaluate current evidence for BC screening and prevention.
Evidence acquisition
Data on the estimated incidence and mortality of BC for 2020 in 185 countries were derived from the International Agency for Research on Cancer GLOBOCAN database. A review of English-language articles published over the past 5 yr was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE to identify risk factors in addition to contemporary evidence on BC screening and prevention.
Evidence synthesis
BC is the tenth most common cancer worldwide, with 573 278 cases in 2020. BC incidence is approximately fourfold higher in men than women. Tobacco smoking remains the principal risk factor, accounting for approximately 50\% of cases. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine BC screening. However, targeted screening of high-risk individuals (defined according to smoking history or occupational exposure) may reduce BC mortality and should be the focus of prospective randomized trials. In terms of disease prevention, smoking cessation represents the most important intervention, followed by a reduction in exposure to occupational and environmental carcinogens.
Conclusions
BC confers a significant disease burden. An understanding of BC epidemiology and risk factors provides an optimal foundation for disease prevention and the care of affected patients.
Patient summary
Bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer worldwide and is approximately four times more common among men than among women. The main risk factors are tobacco smoking, followed by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace or the environment. Routine screening is not currently recommended, but may be beneficial in individuals at high risk, such as heavy smokers. Primary prevention is extremely important, and smoking cessation represents the most important action for reducing bladder cancer cases and deaths.},

	doi = {10.1186/1475-2891-12-149},
	abstract = {Background
Limited data exist on the contribution of dietary sources of arsenic to an individual’s total exposure, particularly in populations with exposure via drinking water. Here, the association between diet and toenail arsenic concentrations (a long-term biomarker of exposure) was evaluated for individuals with measured household tap water arsenic. Foods known to be high in arsenic, including rice and seafood, were of particular interest.

Methods
Associations between toenail arsenic and consumption of 120 individual diet items were quantified using general linear models that also accounted for household tap water arsenic and potentially confounding factors (e.g., age, caloric intake, sex, smoking) (n = 852). As part of the analysis, we assessed whether associations between log-transformed toenail arsenic and each diet item differed between subjects with household drinking water arsenic concentrations {\textless}1 μg/L versus ≥1 μg/L.

Results
As expected, toenail arsenic concentrations increased with household water arsenic concentrations. Among the foods known to be high in arsenic, no clear relationship between toenail arsenic and rice consumption was detected, but there was a positive association with consumption of dark meat fish, a category that includes tuna steaks, mackerel, salmon, sardines, bluefish, and swordfish. Positive associations between toenail arsenic and consumption of white wine, beer, and Brussels sprouts were also observed; these and most other associations were not modified by exposure via water. However, consumption of two foods cooked in water, beans/lentils and cooked oatmeal, was more strongly related to toenail arsenic among those with arsenic-containing drinking water (≥1 μg/L).

Conclusions
This study suggests that diet can be an important contributor to total arsenic exposure in U.S. populations regardless of arsenic concentrations in drinking water. Thus, dietary exposure to arsenic in the US warrants consideration as a potential health risk.},

We performed a genome-wide interaction study (GWAS) of smoking and bladder cancer risk based on primary scan data from 3002 cases and 4411 controls from the National Cancer Institute Bladder Cancer GWAS. Alternative methods were used to evaluate both additive and multiplicative interactions between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and smoking exposure. SNPs with interaction P values {\textless} 5 × 10(-) (5) were evaluated further in an independent dataset of 2422 bladder cancer cases and 5751 controls. We identified 10 SNPs that showed association in a consistent manner with the initial dataset and in the combined dataset, providing evidence of interaction with tobacco use. Further, two of these novel SNPs showed strong evidence of association with bladder cancer in tobacco use subgroups that approached genome-wide significance. Specifically, rs1711973 (FOXF2) on 6p25.3 was a susceptibility SNP for never smokers [combined odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.20-1.50, P value = 5.18 × 10(-) (7)]; and rs12216499 (RSPH3-TAGAP-EZR) on 6q25.3 was a susceptibility SNP for ever smokers (combined OR = 0.75, 95\% CI = 0.67-0.84, P value = 6.35 × 10(-) (7)). In our analysis of smoking and bladder cancer, the tests for multiplicative interaction seemed to more commonly identify susceptibility loci with associations in never smokers, whereas the additive interaction analysis identified more loci with associations among smokers-including the known smoking and NAT2 acetylation interaction.

	abstract = {Several studies have suggested arsenic may target important tumor-suppresser genes and disrupt cell cycle control and influence bladder cancer risk. In a large, population-based case-control study we evaluated whether there was heterogeneity in the arsenic-bladder cancer risk relationship by tumor expression of p16 and Rb. Tumor tissue from bladder cancer cases was assembled as tissue microarrays and examined for expression. Cutoff values used to define negative/positive staining were based on the distribution of the percentage of positive cells in cases. Data on cumulative arsenic from drinking water were used to evaluate the relationship between arsenic and bladder cancer by immunophenotype (p16-/p16\&\#43;,Rb-/Rb\&\#43;), in 424 cases and 1287 controls, using polytomous logistic regression. Our results show that the association between increasing cumulative arsenic and bladder cancer risk was only apparent among patients with p16\&\#43; or Rb\&\#43; tumors. We observed a strong monotonic association between risk and increasing cumulative arsenic intake (Quartile2-4 vs. Quartile1, ORp16\&\#43; \&\#61;1.36, 1.47, 1.85, p-trend\&\#61;0.004 and ORRb\&\#43; \&\#61;1.51, 1.56, 1.94, p-trend\&\#61;0.007). No association between cumulative arsenic and risk among patients with p16- or Rb- bladder tumors was apparent (p-heterogeneity by subtype\&\#61;0.0325 for p16 and 0.0551 for Rb). This heterogeneity was not evident by stage or grade. Our data suggest a low frequency of homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (the gene that encodes p16), as well as inactivating mutations of RB1 in arsenic-induced bladder cancer, pointing to an alternate mechanism. Increased p16 expression may be indicative of hypermethylation of CDKN2A, an intensively studied mechanisms for arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. Our data provide additional evidence linking arsenic exposure and bladder cancer risk and point to alterations of the cell cycle as the relevant pathway, although the precise mechanisms need further evaluation in additional experimental and human studies.},

These metabolites are generated throughout  the body, either enzymatically or from oxidative stress, and are detectable in  peripheral circulation. We previously reported that circulating  27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), an endogenous selective estrogen receptor  modulator, may be a risk factor for colorectal adenomas. Here, in addition to  27-OHC, we report on four other circulating oxysterols: 25-hydroxycholesterol,  24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 7ɑ-hydroxycholesterol, and 4β-hydroxycholesterol.  Oxysterol concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography/mass  spectrometry from fasting plasma collected at baseline from 1,246 participants of  the Vitamin D/Calcium Polyp Prevention Study, a multicenter adenoma  chemoprevention trial. To evaluate multiple oxysterols simultaneously, we used  both log-linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression models  developed for analyses of complex mixtures adjusted for potential confounding  factors. Higher circulating 7ɑ-hydroxycholesterol was associated with higher  adenoma risk (Bayesian kernel machine regression-based multivariable-adjusted  risk ratios (RR; for the 75th vs. 25th percentile, 1.22; 95\% credible interval,  CI, 1.04-1.42). In contrast, higher circulating 4β-hydroxycholesterol was  associated with lower risk of these polyps (RR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.99). The  positive association with advanced adenoma risk that we previously reported for  circulating 27-OHC persisted when controlling for other oxysterols (RR, 1.26; 95\%  CI, 0.98-1.62), including among those with advanced adenomas at baseline (RR,  1.75; 95\% CI, 1.01-3.06). Prevention Relevance: Circulating concentrations of  multiple oxysterols measured at the time of an initial colorectal adenoma  diagnosis may be risk factors for subsequent incidence of these lesions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Beta-cell monogenic forms of diabetes have strong support for precision medicine. We systematically analyzed evidence for precision treatments  for GCK-related hyperglycemia, HNF1A-, HNF4A- and HNF1B-diabetes, and  mitochondrial diabetes (MD) due to m.3243 A {\textgreater} G variant, 6q24-transient neonatal  diabetes mellitus (TND) and SLC19A2-diabetes. METHODS: The search of PubMed,  MEDLINE, and Embase for individual and group level data for glycemic outcomes  using inclusion (English, original articles written after 1992) and exclusion  (VUS, multiple diabetes types, absent/aggregated treatment effect measures)  criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using NHLBI study-quality assessment  tools. Data extracted from Covidence were summarized and presented as descriptive  statistics in tables and text. RESULTS: There are 146 studies included, with only  six being experimental studies. For GCK-related hyperglycemia, the six studies  (35 individuals) assessing therapy discontinuation show no HbA1c deterioration. A  randomized trial (18 individuals per group) shows that sulfonylureas (SU) were  more effective in HNF1A-diabetes than in type 2 diabetes. Cohort and case studies  support SU's effectiveness in lowering HbA1c. Two cross-over trials (each with  15-16 individuals) suggest glinides and GLP-1 receptor agonists might be used in  place of SU. Evidence for HNF4A-diabetes is limited. Most reported patients with  HNF1B-diabetes (N = 293) and MD (N = 233) are on insulin without treatment  studies. Limited data support oral agents after relapse in 6q24-TND and for  thiamine improving glycemic control and reducing/eliminating insulin requirement  in SLC19A2-diabetes. CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence, and with moderate or  serious risk of bias, to guide monogenic diabetes treatment. Further evidence is  needed to examine the optimum treatment in monogenic subtypes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lifestyle choices, metformin, and dietary supplements may prevent GDM, but the effect of intervention characteristics has not been identified. This  review evaluated intervention characteristics to inform the implementation of GDM  prevention interventions. METHODS: Ovid, MEDLINE/PubMed, and EMBASE databases  were searched. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR)  framework was used to examine intervention characteristics (who, what, when,  where, and how). Subgroup analysis was performed by intervention characteristics.  RESULTS: 116 studies involving 40,940 participants are included. Group-based  physical activity interventions (RR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.46, 0.95) reduce the incidence  of GDM compared with individual or mixed (individual and group) delivery format  (subgroup p-value = 0.04). Physical activity interventions delivered at  healthcare facilities reduce the risk of GDM (RR 0.59; 95\% CI 0.49, 0.72)  compared with home-based interventions (subgroup p-value = 0.03). No other  intervention characteristics impact the effectiveness of all other interventions.  CONCLUSIONS: Dietary, physical activity, diet plus physical activity, metformin,  and myoinositol interventions reduce the incidence of GDM compared with control  interventions. Group and healthcare facility-based physical activity  interventions show better effectiveness in preventing GDM than individual and  community-based interventions. Other intervention characteristics (e.g.  utilization of e-health) don't impact the effectiveness of lifestyle  interventions, and thus, interventions may require consideration of the local  context.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Islet autoantibodies form the foundation for type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis and staging, but heterogeneity exists in T1D development and  presentation. We hypothesized that autoantibodies can identify heterogeneity  before, at, and after T1D diagnosis, and in response to disease-modifying  therapies. METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed and EMBASE databases  (6/14/2022) assessing 10 years of original research examining relationships  between autoantibodies and heterogeneity before, at, after diagnosis, and in  response to disease-modifying therapies in individuals at-risk or within 1 year  of T1D diagnosis. A critical appraisal checklist tool for cohort studies was  modified and used for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Here we show that 152  studies that met extraction criteria most commonly characterized heterogeneity  before diagnosis (91/152). Autoantibody type/target was most frequently examined,  followed by autoantibody number. Recurring themes included correlations of  autoantibody number, type, and titers with progression, differing phenotypes  based on order of autoantibody seroconversion, and interactions with age and  genetics. Only 44\% specifically described autoantibody assay standardization  program participation. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence most strongly supports the  application of autoantibody features to more precisely define T1D before  diagnosis. Our findings support continued use of pre-clinical staging paradigms  based on autoantibody number and suggest that additional autoantibody features,  particularly in relation to age and genetic risk, could offer more precise  stratification. To improve reproducibility and applicability of  autoantibody-based precision medicine in T1D, we propose a methods checklist for  islet autoantibody-based manuscripts which includes use of precision medicine  MeSH terms and participation in autoantibody standardization workshops.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precision medicine has the potential to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction in individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS:  We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies to  identify potentially novel prognostic factors that may improve CVD risk  prediction in T2D. Out of 9380 studies identified, 416 studies met inclusion  criteria. Outcomes were reported for 321 biomarker studies, 48 genetic marker  studies, and 47 risk score/model studies. RESULTS: Out of all evaluated  biomarkers, only 13 showed improvement in prediction performance. Results of  pooled meta-analyses, non-pooled analyses, and assessments of improvement in  prediction performance and risk of bias, yielded the highest predictive utility  for N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (high-evidence),  troponin-T (TnT) (moderate-evidence), triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index  (moderate-evidence), Genetic Risk Score for Coronary Heart Disease (GRS-CHD)  (moderate-evidence); moderate predictive utility for coronary computed tomography  angiography (low-evidence), single-photon emission computed tomography  (low-evidence), pulse wave velocity (moderate-evidence); and low predictive  utility for C-reactive protein (moderate-evidence), coronary artery calcium score  (low-evidence), galectin-3 (low-evidence), troponin-I (low-evidence), carotid  plaque (low-evidence), and growth differentiation factor-15 (low-evidence). Risk  scores showed modest discrimination, with lower performance in populations  different from the original development cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high  interest in this topic, very few studies conducted rigorous analyses to  demonstrate incremental predictive utility beyond established CVD risk factors  for T2D. The most promising markers identified were NT-proBNP, TnT, TyG and  GRS-CHD, with the highest strength of evidence for NT-proBNP. Further research is  needed to determine their clinical utility in risk stratification and management  of CVD in T2D.},

METHODS: This review  included studies published in English language from January 1st, 1990, through  September 30th, 2021, that focused on the above outcomes of interest with respect  to sociodemographic factors, lifestyle and behavioral characteristics,  traditional clinical traits, and 'omics biomarkers in the mothers and offspring  during the perinatal/postpartum periods and across the lifecourse. Studies that  did not report associations of prognostic factors with outcomes of interest among  GDM-exposed women or children were excluded. RESULTS: Here, we identified 109  publications comprising 98 observational studies and 11 randomized-controlled  trials. Findings indicate that GDM severity, maternal obesity, race/ethnicity,  and unhealthy diet and physical activity levels predict T2D and CVD in women, and  greater cardiometabolic risk in offspring. However, using the Diabetes Canada  2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines for studies, the level of evidence was low due  to potential for confounding, reverse causation, and selection biases.  CONCLUSIONS: GDM pregnancies with greater severity, as well as those accompanied  by maternal obesity, unhealthy diet, and low physical activity, as well as cases  that occur among women who identify as racial/ethnic minorities are associated  with worse cardiometabolic prognosis in mothers and offspring. However, given the  low quality of evidence, prospective studies with detailed covariate data  collection and high fidelity of follow-up are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perinatal outcomes vary for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The precise factors beyond glycemic status that may refine GDM diagnosis  remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of potential  precision markers for GDM. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed  in PubMed and EMBASE from inception to March 2022 for studies comparing perinatal  outcomes among women with GDM. We searched for precision markers in the following  categories: maternal anthropometrics, clinical/sociocultural factors,  non-glycemic biochemical markers, genetics/genomics or other -omics, and fetal  biometry. We conducted post-hoc meta-analyses of a subset of studies with data on  the association of maternal body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) with offspring  macrosomia or large-for-gestational age (LGA). RESULTS: A total of 5905  titles/abstracts were screened, 775 full-texts reviewed, and 137 studies  synthesized. Maternal anthropometrics were the most frequent risk marker.  Meta-analysis demonstrated that women with GDM and overweight/obesity vs. GDM  with normal range BMI are at higher risk of offspring macrosomia (13 studies  [n = 28,763]; odds ratio [OR] 2.65; 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.91, 3.68), and  LGA (10 studies [n = 20,070]; OR 2.23; 95\% CI 2.00, 2.49). Lipids and insulin  resistance/secretion indices were the most studied non-glycemic biochemical  markers, with increased triglycerides and insulin resistance generally associated  with greater risk of offspring macrosomia or LGA. Studies evaluating other  markers had inconsistent findings as to whether they could be used as precision  markers. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal overweight/obesity is associated with greater risk  of offspring macrosomia or LGA in women with GDM. Pregnancy insulin resistance or  hypertriglyceridemia may be useful in GDM risk stratification. Future studies  examining non-glycemic biochemical, genetic, other -omic, or sociocultural  precision markers among women with GDM are warranted.},

We undertook a systematic review to determine whether strategies to subclassify  type 2 diabetes were associated with high quality evidence, reproducible results  and improved outcomes for patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for  publications that used 'simple subclassification' approaches using simple  categorisation of clinical characteristics, or 'complex subclassification'  approaches which used machine learning or 'omics approaches in people with  established type 2 diabetes. We excluded other diabetes subtypes and those  predicting incident type 2 diabetes. We assessed quality, reproducibility and  clinical relevance of extracted full-text articles and qualitatively synthesised  a summary of subclassification approaches. RESULTS: Here we show data from 51  studies that demonstrate many simple stratification approaches, but none have  been replicated and many are not associated with meaningful clinical outcomes.  Complex stratification was reviewed in 62 studies and produced reproducible  subtypes of type 2 diabetes that are associated with outcomes. Both approaches  require a higher grade of evidence but support the premise that type 2 diabetes  can be subclassified into clinically meaningful subtypes. CONCLUSION: Critical  next steps toward clinical implementation are to test whether subtypes exist in  more diverse ancestries and whether tailoring interventions to subtypes will  improve outcomes.},

Diabetes affects hundreds of  millions of people worldwide, many of whom will develop life-threatening  complications and die prematurely. Precision medicine can potentially address  this enormous problem by accounting for heterogeneity in the etiology, clinical  presentation and pathogenesis of common forms of diabetes and risks of  complications. This second international consensus report on precision diabetes  medicine summarizes the findings from a systematic evidence review across the key  pillars of precision medicine (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis) in  four recognized forms of diabetes (monogenic, gestational, type 1, type 2). These  reviews address key questions about the translation of precision medicine  research into practice. Although not complete, owing to the vast literature on  this topic, they revealed opportunities for the immediate or near-term clinical  implementation of precision diabetes medicine; furthermore, we expose important  gaps in knowledge, focusing on the need to obtain new clinically relevant  evidence. Gaps include the need for common standards for clinical readiness,  including consideration of cost-effectiveness, health equity, predictive  accuracy, liability and accessibility.

We hypothesized that a precision medicine approach could be a tool  for risk-stratification of women to streamline successful GDM management. With  the relatively short timeframe available to treat GDM, commencing effective  therapy earlier, with more rapid normalization of hyperglycaemia, could have  benefits for both mother and fetus. METHODS: We conducted two systematic reviews,  to identify precision markers that may predict effective lifestyle and  pharmacological interventions. RESULTS: There was a paucity of studies examining  precision lifestyle-based interventions for GDM highlighting the pressing need  for further research in this area. We found a number of precision markers  identified from routine clinical measures that may enable earlier identification  of those requiring escalation of pharmacological therapy (to metformin,  sulphonylureas or insulin). This included previous history of GDM, Body Mass  Index and blood glucose concentrations at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical  measurements at diagnosis could potentially be used as precision markers in the  treatment of GDM. Whether there are other sensitive markers that could be  identified using more complex individual-level data, such as omics, and if these  can feasibly be implemented in clinical practice remains unknown. These will be  important to consider in future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. Prevention efforts have focused on immune  modulation and supporting beta cell health before or around diagnosis; however,  heterogeneity in disease progression and therapy response has limited translation  to clinical practice, highlighting the need for precision medicine approaches to  T1D disease modification. METHODS: To understand the state of knowledge in this  area, we performed a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials with ≥50  participants cataloged in PubMed or Embase from the past 25 years testing T1D  disease-modifying therapies and/or identifying features linked to treatment  response, analyzing bias using a Cochrane-risk-of-bias instrument. RESULTS: We  identify and summarize 75 manuscripts, 15 describing 11 prevention trials for  individuals with increased risk for T1D, and 60 describing treatments aimed at  preventing beta cell loss at disease onset. Seventeen interventions, mostly  immunotherapies, show benefit compared to placebo (only two prior to T1D onset).  Fifty-seven studies employ precision analyses to assess features linked to  treatment response. Age, beta cell function measures, and immune phenotypes are  most frequently tested. However, analyses are typically not prespecified, with  inconsistent methods of reporting, and tend to report positive findings.  CONCLUSIONS: While the quality of prevention and intervention trials is overall  high, the low quality of precision analyses makes it difficult to draw meaningful  conclusions that inform clinical practice. To facilitate precision medicine  approaches to T1D prevention, considerations for future precision studies include  the incorporation of uniform outcome measures, reproducible biomarkers, and  prespecified, fully powered precision analyses into future trial design.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A precision medicine approach in type 2 diabetes requires the identification of clinical and biological features that are reproducibly  associated with differences in clinical outcomes with specific  anti-hyperglycaemic therapies. Robust evidence of such treatment effect  heterogeneity could support more individualized clinical decisions on optimal  type 2 diabetes therapy. METHODS: We performed a pre-registered systematic review  of meta-analysis studies, randomized control trials, and observational studies  evaluating clinical and biological features associated with heterogenous  treatment effects for SGLT2-inhibitor and GLP1-receptor agonist therapies,  considering glycaemic, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes. After screening 5,686  studies, we included 101 studies of SGLT2-inhibitors and 75 studies of  GLP1-receptor agonists in the final systematic review. RESULTS: Here we show that  the majority of included papers have methodological limitations precluding robust  assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity. For SGLT2-inhibitors, multiple  observational studies suggest lower renal function as a predictor of lesser  glycaemic response, while markers of reduced insulin secretion predict lesser  glycaemic response with GLP1-receptor agonists. For both therapies, multiple  post-hoc analyses of randomized control trials (including trial meta-analysis)  identify minimal clinically relevant treatment effect heterogeneity for  cardiovascular and renal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence on treatment  effect heterogeneity for SGLT2-inhibitor and GLP1-receptor agonist therapies is  limited, likely reflecting the methodological limitations of published studies.  Robust and appropriately powered studies are required to understand type 2  diabetes treatment effect heterogeneity and evaluate the potential for precision  medicine to inform future clinical care.},

On this  basis, four recommendations for who to test and five on how to test for monogenic  diabetes are provided. Existing guidelines for variant curation and gene-disease  validity curation are summarized. Reporting by gene names is recommended as an  alternative to the term MODY.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precision prevention involves using the unique characteristics of a particular group to determine their responses to preventive interventions. This  study aimed to systematically evaluate the participant characteristics associated  with responses to interventions in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)  prevention. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Pubmed to identify  lifestyle (diet, physical activity, or both), metformin, myoinositol/inositol and  probiotics interventions of GDM prevention published up to May 24, 2022. RESULTS:  From 10347 studies, 116 studies (n = 40940 women) are included. Physical activity  results in greater GDM reduction in participants with a normal body mass index  (BMI) at baseline compared to obese BMI (risk ratio, 95\% confidence interval:  0.06 [0.03, 0.14] vs 0.68 [0.26, 1.60]). Combined diet and physical activity  interventions result in greater GDM reduction in participants without polycystic  ovary syndrome (PCOS) than those with PCOS (0.62 [0.47, 0.82] vs 1.12  [0.78-1.61]) and in those without a history of GDM than those with unspecified  GDM history (0.62 [0.47, 0.81] vs 0.85 [0.76, 0.95]). Metformin interventions are  more effective in participants with PCOS than those with unspecified status (0.38  [0.19, 0.74] vs 0.59 [0.25, 1.43]), or when commenced preconception than during  pregnancy (0.21 [0.11, 0.40] vs 1.15 [0.86-1.55]). Parity, history of having a  large-for-gestational-age infant or family history of diabetes have no effect on  intervention responses. CONCLUSIONS: GDM prevention through metformin or  lifestyle differs according to some individual characteristics. Future research  should include trials commencing preconception and provide results disaggregated  by a priori defined participant characteristics including social and  environmental factors, clinical traits, and other novel risk factors to predict  GDM prevention through interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The greatest change in the treatment of people living with type 1 diabetes in the last decade has been the explosion of technology assisting in all  aspects of diabetes therapy, from glucose monitoring to insulin delivery and  decision making. As such, the aim of our systematic review was to assess the  utility of these technologies as well as identify any precision medicine-directed  findings to personalize care. METHODS: Screening of 835 peer-reviewed articles  was followed by systematic review of 70 of them (focusing on randomized trials  and extension studies with ≥50 participants from the past 10 years). RESULTS: We  find that novel technologies, ranging from continuous glucose monitoring systems,  insulin pumps and decision support tools to the most advanced hybrid closed loop  systems, improve important measures like HbA1c, time in range, and glycemic  variability, while reducing hypoglycemia risk. Several studies included  person-reported outcomes, allowing assessment of the burden or benefit of the  technology in the lives of those with type 1 diabetes, demonstrating positive  results or, at a minimum, no increase in self-care burden compared with standard  care. Important limitations of the trials to date are their small size, the  scarcity of pre-planned or powered analyses in sub-populations such as children,  racial/ethnic minorities, people with advanced complications, and variations in  baseline glycemic levels. In addition, confounders including education with  device initiation, concomitant behavioral modifications, and frequent contact  with the healthcare team are rarely described in enough detail to assess their  impact. CONCLUSIONS: Our review highlights the potential of technology in the  treatment of people living with type 1 diabetes and provides suggestions for  optimization of outcomes and areas of further study for precision  medicine-directed technology use in type 1 diabetes.},

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies  reporting on the effect of a lifestyle, dietary pattern, or dietary supplement  interventions on the incidence of T2D and reporting the results stratified by any  effect modifier. We extracted relevant statistical findings and qualitatively  synthesized the evidence for each modifier based on the direction of findings  reported in available studies. We used the Diabetes Canada Clinical Practice  Scale to assess the certainty of the evidence for a given effect modifier.  RESULTS: The 81 publications that met our criteria for inclusion are from 33  unique trials. The evidence is low to very low to attribute variability in  intervention effectiveness to individual characteristics such as age, sex, BMI,  race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, baseline behavioral factors, or genetic  predisposition.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monogenic insulin resistance (IR) includes lipodystrophy and disorders of insulin signalling. We sought to assess the effects of interventions  in monogenic IR, stratified by genetic aetiology. METHODS: Systematic review  using PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase (1 January 1987 to 23 June 2021). Studies  reporting individual-level effects of pharmacologic and/or surgical interventions  in monogenic IR were eligible. Individual data were extracted and duplicates were  removed. Outcomes were analysed for each gene and intervention, and in aggregate  for partial, generalised and all lipodystrophy. RESULTS: 10 non-randomised  experimental studies, 8 case series, and 23 case reports meet inclusion criteria,  all rated as having moderate or serious risk of bias. Metreleptin use is  associated with the lowering of triglycerides and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in all  lipodystrophy (n = 111), partial (n = 71) and generalised lipodystrophy (n = 41),  and in LMNA, PPARG, AGPAT2 or BSCL2 subgroups (n = 72,13,21 and 21 respectively).  Body Mass Index (BMI) is lowered in partial and generalised lipodystrophy, and in  LMNA or BSCL2, but not PPARG or AGPAT2 subgroups. Thiazolidinediones are  associated with improved HbA1c and triglycerides in all lipodystrophy (n = 13),  improved HbA1c in PPARG (n = 5), and improved triglycerides in LMNA (n = 7). In  INSR-related IR, rhIGF-1, alone or with IGFBP3, is associated with improved HbA1c  (n = 17). The small size or absence of other genotype-treatment combinations  preclude firm conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence guiding genotype-specific  treatment of monogenic IR is of low to very low quality. Metreleptin and  Thiazolidinediones appear to improve metabolic markers in lipodystrophy, and  rhIGF-1 appears to lower HbA1c in INSR-related IR. For other interventions, there  is insufficient evidence to assess efficacy and risks in aggregated lipodystrophy  or genetic subgroups.},

This study aimed first to identify  distinct subgroups of response in children living with overweight and obesity and  second to elucidate predictors for subclusters. METHODS: Based on the obesity  patient follow-up registry the APV (Adipositas-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation)  initiative, a total of 12,453 children and adolescents (median age: 11.5 [IQR:  9.7-13.2] years; BMI z score [BMIz]: 2.06 [IQR: 1.79-2.34]; 52.6\% girls) living  with overweight/obesity and participating in outpatient LI were studied.  Longitudinal k-means clustering was used to identify individual BMIz response  curve for up to 2 years after treatment initiation. Multinomial logistic  regression was used to elucidate predictors for cluster membership. RESULTS: A  total of 36.3\% of children and adolescents experienced "no BMIz loss." The  largest subcluster (44.8\%) achieved "moderate BMIz loss," with an average  delta-BMIz of -0.23 (IQR: -0.33 to -0.14) at study end. A total of 18.9\% had a  "pronounced BMIz loss" up to -0.61 (IQR: -0.76 to -0.49). Younger age and lower  BMIz at LI initiation, larger initial BMIz loss, and less social deprivation were  linked with higher likelihood for moderate or pronounced BMIz loss compared with  the no BMIz loss cluster (all p {\textless} 0.05).

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Women and underrepresented groups in medicine hold few academic leadership positions in the field of hematology/oncology. In this study, we  assessed gender and race/ethnicity representation in editorial board positions in  hematology/oncology journals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Editorial leadership board  members from 60 major journals in hematology and oncology were reviewed; 54  journals were included in the final analysis. Gender and race/ethnicity were  determined based on publicly available data for Editor-in-Chief (EiC) and  Second-in-Command (SiC) (including deputy, senior, or associate editors).  Descriptive statistics and chi-squared were estimated. In the second phase of the  study, editors were emailed a 4-item survey to self-identify their demographics.  RESULTS: Out of 793 editorial board members, 72.6\% were men and 27.4\% were women.  Editorial leadership were non-Hispanic white (71.1\%) with Asian editorial board  members representing the second largest majority at 22.5\%. Women comprised only  15.9\% of the EiC positions (90\% White and 10\% Asian). Women were about half as  likely to be in the EiC position compared with men [pOR 0.47 (95\% CI, 0.23-0.95,  P = .03)]. Women represented 28.3\% of SiC editorial positions. Surgical oncology  had the lowest female representation at 2.3\%. CONCLUSION: Women and minorities  are significantly underrepresented in leadership roles on Editorial Boards in  hematology/oncology journals. Importantly, the representation of minority women  physicians in EiC positions is at an inexorable zero.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Survivorship care plan (SCP) is a tool to improve communication between oncologists and primary care physicians. Internal medicine residency  curricula are lacking training for cancer survivorship and SCPs. Here, we aimed  to assess the awareness and utilization of SCPs in medicine trainees. METHODS: A  pilot survey investigating awareness and experience with SCPs was distributed  among internal medicine trainees in an outpatient setting. Participants were  stratified by program type (transitional and categorical) and year of training.  Differences in proportions were tested with parametric and non-parametric tests.  RESULTS: All thirty-seven participants who were administered a survey responded;  32.4\% and 67.6\% were transitional and categorical trainees, respectively; 54\%  were PGY-1, 21.6\% PGY-2, and 24.3\% PGY-3. None of the trainees reported following  a SCP for cancer-free patients nor plans to use SCP as a source to obtain  information. Up to 78.3\% and 92.6\% of participants reported that they were not  taught about SCPs during their residency or medical school, respectively. The  most frequent barriers to discuss cancer history and SCP with their patients  were: insufficient or lack of information about SCPs (83.8\%), patients'  information as a source deemed "unreliable" (81.1\%), and uncertainty if the  patient has SCP (81.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness and use of cancer SCPs among  internal medicine trainees is limited, furthermore, a sizeable proportion  reported not having accessed or received any training for SCPs. Efforts intended  to facilitate SCP use and educate trainees about cancer survivorship may prove to  be an effective strategy to increase the quality of care to cancer survivors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 receptor agonists lower blood glucose concentrations, body weight, and have cardiovascular benefits. The  efficacy and side effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists vary between people. Human  pharmacogenomic studies of this inter-individual variation can provide both  biological insight into drug action and provide biomarkers to inform clinical  decision making. We therefore aimed to identify genetic variants associated with  glycaemic response to GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment. METHODS: In this  genome-wide analysis we included adults (aged ≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes  treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists with baseline HbA(1c) of 7\% or more (53  mmol/mol) from four prospective observational cohorts (DIRECT, PRIBA, PROMASTER,  and GoDARTS) and two randomised clinical trials (HARMONY phase 3 and AWARD). The  primary endpoint was HbA(1c) reduction at 6 months after starting GLP-1 receptor  agonists. We evaluated variants in GLP1R, then did a genome-wide association  study and gene-based burden tests. FINDINGS: 4571 adults were included in our  analysis, of these, 3339 (73\%) were White European, 449 (10\%) Hispanic, 312 (7\%)  American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 471 (10\%) were other, and around 2140  (47\%) of the participants were women. Variation in HbA(1c) reduction with GLP-1  receptor agonists treatment was associated with rs6923761G→A (Gly168Ser) in the  GLP1R (0·08\% [95\% CI 0·04-0·12] or 0·9 mmol/mol lower reduction in HbA(1c) per  serine, p=6·0 × 10(-5)) and low frequency variants in ARRB1 (optimal sequence  kernel association test p=6·7 × 10(-8)), largely driven by rs140226575G→A  (Thr370Met; 0·25\% [SE 0·06] or 2·7 mmol/mol  [SE 0·7] greater HbA(1c) reduction  per methionine, p=5·2 × 10(-6)). A similar effect size for the ARRB1 Thr370Met  was seen in Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native populations who have a  higher frequency of this variant (6-11\%) than in White European populations.  Combining these two genes identified 4\% of the population who had a 30\% greater  reduction in HbA(1c) than the 9\% of the population with the worse response.  INTERPRETATION: This genome-wide pharmacogenomic study of GLP-1 receptor agonists  provides novel biological and clinical insights. Clinically, when genotype is  routinely available at the point of prescribing, individuals with ARRB1 variants  might benefit from earlier initiation of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

	abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Excess adiposity is differentially associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease in men and women, according to observational  studies. Causal inference studies largely assume a linear relationship between  BMI and cardiometabolic outcomes, which may not be the case. In this study, we  investigated the shapes of the causal relationships between BMI and  cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors. We further investigated sex  differences within the causal framework. METHODS: To assess causal relationships  between BMI and the outcomes, we used two-stage least-squares Mendelian  randomisation (MR), with a polygenic risk score for BMI as the instrumental  variable. To elucidate the shapes of the causal relationships, we used a  non-linear MR fractional polynomial method, and used piecewise MR to investigate  threshold relationships and confirm the shapes. RESULTS: BMI was associated with  type 2 diabetes (OR 3.10; 95\% CI 2.73, 3.53), hypertension (OR 1.53; 95\% CI 1.44,  1.62) and coronary artery disease (OR 1.20; 95\% CI 1.08, 1.33), but not chronic  kidney disease (OR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.67, 1.72) or stroke (OR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.92,  1.28). The data suggest that these relationships are non-linear. For  cardiometabolic risk factors, BMI was positively associated with glucose,  HbA(1c), triacylglycerol levels and both systolic and diastolic BP. BMI had an  inverse causal relationship with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and  HDL-cholesterol. The data suggest a non-linear causal relationship between BMI  and BP and other biomarkers (p{\textless}0.001) except lipoprotein A. The piecewise MR  results were consistent with the fractional polynomial results. The causal effect  of BMI on coronary artery disease, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was  different in men and women, but this sex difference was only significant for  LDL-cholesterol after controlling for multiple testing (p{\textless}0.001). Further, the  causal effect of BMI on coronary artery disease varied by menopause status in  women. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We describe the shapes of causal effects of  BMI on cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors, and report sex differences in  the causal effects of BMI on LDL-cholesterol. We found evidence of non-linearity  in the causal effect of BMI on diseases and risk factor biomarkers. Reducing  excess adiposity is highly beneficial for health, but there is greater need to  consider biological sex in the management of adiposity.},

Data on clinical outcomes (i.e., type 2 diabetes (T2D) and  cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence) were obtained by linking health registry  data. We assessed the magnitude of direct and mediated effects of diet, adiposity  and physical activity on T2D and CVD using structural equation modelling (SEM).  To strengthen causal inference, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) to model  macronutrient intake exposures against clinical outcomes. We identified likely  causal effects of genetically predicted carbohydrate intake (including sugar  intake) and T2D, independent of adiposity and physical activity. Pairwise,  serial- and parallel-mediational configurations yielded similar results. In the  integrative genomic analyses, the candidate causal variant localized to the  established T2D gene TCF7L2.

Conversely, those with IA1c showed higher insulin sensitivity and ISR(r)  (P {\textless} 0.0001). Among groups with two defects, we similarly found differences in  both BCF and insulin sensitivity. At 48 months, we found higher type 2 diabetes  incidence for progressively increasing number of prediabetes defects (odds ratio  {\textgreater}2, P {\textless} 0.008). In conclusion, the prediabetes groups showed differences in  type/degree of glucometabolic impairment. Compared with the pooled group with  isolated defects, those with double or triple defect showed progressive  differences in diabetes incidence.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the processes underlying glycemic deterioration in type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 732 recently  diagnosed patients with T2D from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Diabetes  Research on Patient Stratification (IMI DIRECT) study were extensively phenotyped  over 3 years, including measures of insulin sensitivity (OGIS), β-cell glucose  sensitivity (GS), and insulin clearance (CLIm) from mixed meal tests, liver  enzymes, lipid profiles, and baseline regional fat from MRI. The associations  between the longitudinal metabolic patterns and HbA(1c) deterioration, adjusted  for changes in BMI and in diabetes medications, were assessed via stepwise  multivariable linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: Faster HbA(1c) progression  was independently associated with faster deterioration of OGIS and GS and  increasing CLIm; visceral or liver fat, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides had  further independent, though weaker, roles (R (2) = 0.38). A subgroup of patients  with a markedly higher progression rate (fast progressors) was clearly  distinguishable considering these variables only (discrimination capacity from  area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.94). The proportion of fast  progressors was reduced from 56\% to 8-10\% in subgroups in which only one trait  among OGIS, GS, and CLIm was relatively stable (odds ratios 0.07-0.09). T2D  polygenic risk score and baseline pancreatic fat, glucagon-like peptide 1,  glucagon, diet, and physical activity did not show an independent role.  CONCLUSIONS: Deteriorating insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, increasing  insulin clearance, high visceral or liver fat, and worsening of the lipid profile  are the crucial factors mediating glycemic deterioration of patients with T2D in  the initial phase of the disease. Stabilization of a single trait among insulin  sensitivity, β-cell function, and insulin clearance may be relevant to prevent  progression.},

	abstract = {The serum metabolome contains a plethora of biomarkers and causative agents of various diseases, some of which are endogenously produced and some that have been  taken up from the environment(1). The origins of specific compounds are known,  including metabolites that are highly heritable(2,3), or those that are  influenced by the gut microbiome(4), by lifestyle choices such as smoking(5), or  by diet(6). However, the key determinants of most metabolites are still poorly  understood. Here we measured the levels of 1,251 metabolites in serum samples  from a unique and deeply phenotyped healthy human cohort of 491 individuals. We  applied machine-learning algorithms to predict metabolite levels in held-out  individuals on the basis of host genetics, gut microbiome, clinical parameters,  diet, lifestyle and anthropometric measurements, and obtained statistically  significant predictions for more than 76\% of the profiled metabolites. Diet and  microbiome had the strongest predictive power, and each explained hundreds of  metabolites-in some cases, explaining more than 50\% of the observed variance. We  further validated microbiome-related predictions by showing a high replication  rate in two geographically independent cohorts(7,8) that were not available to us  when we trained the algorithms. We used feature attribution analysis(9) to reveal  specific dietary and bacterial interactions. We further demonstrate that some of  these interactions might be causal, as some metabolites that we predicted to be  positively associated with bread were found to increase after a randomized  clinical trial of bread intervention. Overall, our results reveal potential  determinants of more than 800 metabolites, paving the way towards a mechanistic  understanding of alterations in metabolites under different conditions and to  designing interventions for manipulating the levels of circulating metabolites.},

Globally, {\textasciitilde}352 million people have prediabetes, of  which 35-50\% develop full-blown diabetes within five years.

Here we report a causal inference analysis investigating the effects of  prediabetes in coronary artery disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease,  complemented by a systematic review of relevant observational studies. Although  the observational studies suggest that prediabetes is broadly associated with  diabetes complications, the causal inference analysis revealed that prediabetes  is only causally related with coronary artery disease, with no evidence of causal  effects on other diabetes complications. In conclusion, prediabetes likely causes  coronary artery disease and its prevention is likely to be most effective if  initiated prior to the onset of diabetes.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologists have for many decades reported on the patterns and distributions of diabetes within and between populations and have helped to elucidate the  aetiology of the disease. This has helped raise awareness of the tremendous  burden the disease places on individuals and societies; it has also identified  key risk factors that have become the focus of diabetes prevention trials and  helped shape public health recommendations. Recent developments in affordable  high-throughput genetic and molecular phenotyping technologies have driven the  emergence of a new type of epidemiology with a more mechanistic focus than ever  before. Studies employing these technologies have identified gene variants or  causal loci, and linked these to other omics data that help define the molecular  processes mediating the effects of genetic variation in the expression of  clinical phenotypes. The scale of these epidemiological studies is rapidly  growing; a trend that is set to continue as the public and private sectors invest  heavily in omics data generation. Many are banking on this massive volume of  diverse molecular data for breakthroughs in drug discovery and predicting  sensitivity to risk factors, response to therapies and susceptibility to diabetes  complications, as well as the development of disease-monitoring tools and  surrogate outcomes. To realise these possibilities, it is essential that omics  technologies are applied to well-designed epidemiological studies and that the  emerging data are carefully analysed and interpreted. One might view this as  next-generation epidemiology, where complex high-dimensionality data analysis  approaches will need to be blended with many of the core principles of  epidemiological research. In this article, we review the literature on omics in  diabetes epidemiology and discuss how this field is evolving. Graphical abstract.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent and causes serious health complications in individuals with and without type 2  diabetes (T2D). Early diagnosis of NAFLD is important, as this can help prevent  irreversible damage to the liver and, ultimately, hepatocellular carcinomas. We  sought to expand etiological understanding and develop a diagnostic tool for  NAFLD using machine learning. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We utilized the baseline data  from IMI DIRECT, a multicenter prospective cohort study of 3,029  European-ancestry adults recently diagnosed with T2D (n = 795) or at high risk of  developing the disease (n = 2,234). Multi-omics (genetic, transcriptomic,  proteomic, and metabolomic) and clinical (liver enzymes and other serological  biomarkers, anthropometry, measures of beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity,  and lifestyle) data comprised the key input variables. The models were trained on  MRI-image-derived liver fat content ({\textless}5\% or ≥5\%) available for 1,514  participants. We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)  to select features from the different layers of omics data and random forest  analysis to develop the models. The prediction models included clinical and omics  variables separately or in combination. A model including all omics and clinical  variables yielded a cross-validated receiver operating characteristic area under  the curve (ROCAUC) of 0.84 (95\% CI 0.82, 0.86; p {\textless} 0.001), which compared with a  ROCAUC of 0.82 (95\% CI 0.81, 0.83; p {\textless} 0.001) for a model including 9 clinically  accessible variables. The IMI DIRECT prediction models outperformed existing  noninvasive NAFLD prediction tools. One limitation is that these analyses were  performed in adults of European ancestry residing in northern Europe, and it is  unknown how well these findings will translate to people of other ancestries and  exposed to environmental risk factors that differ from those of the present  cohort. Another key limitation of this study is that the prediction was done on a  binary outcome of liver fat quantity ({\textless}5\% or ≥5\%) rather than a continuous one.  CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed several models with different  combinations of clinical and omics data and identified biological features that  appear to be associated with liver fat accumulation. In general, the clinical  variables showed better prediction ability than the complex omics variables.  However, the combination of omics and clinical variables yielded the highest  accuracy. We have incorporated the developed clinical models into a web interface  (see: https://www.predictliverfat.org/) and made it available to the community.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Excess liver iron content is common and is linked to the risk of hepatic and extrahepatic diseases. We aimed to identify genetic variants  influencing liver iron content and use genetics to understand its link to other  traits and diseases. METHODS: First, we performed a genome-wide association study  (GWAS) in 8,289 individuals from UK Biobank, whose liver iron level had been  quantified by magnetic resonance imaging, before validating our findings in an  independent cohort (n = 1,513 from IMI DIRECT). Second, we used Mendelian  randomisation to test the causal effects of 25 predominantly metabolic traits on  liver iron content. Third, we tested phenome-wide associations between liver iron  variants and 770 traits and disease outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 3  independent genetic variants (rs1800562 [C282Y] and rs1799945 [H63D] in HFE and  rs855791 [V736A] in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron content that reached the  GWAS significance threshold (p {\textless}5 × 10(-8)). The 2 HFE variants account for ∼85\%  of all cases of hereditary haemochromatosis. Mendelian randomisation analysis  provided evidence that higher central obesity plays a causal role in increased  liver iron content. Phenome-wide association analysis demonstrated shared  aetiopathogenic mechanisms for elevated liver iron, high blood pressure,  cirrhosis, malignancies, neuropsychiatric and rheumatological conditions, while  also highlighting inverse associations with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic  heart disease. CONCLUSION: Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms  underlying higher liver iron content are likely systemic rather than organ  specific, that higher central obesity is causally associated with higher liver  iron, and that liver iron shares common aetiology with multiple metabolic and  non-metabolic diseases. LAY SUMMARY: Excess liver iron content is common and is  associated with liver diseases and metabolic diseases including diabetes, high  blood pressure, and heart disease. We identified 3 genetic variants that are  linked to an increased risk of developing higher liver iron content. We show that  the same genetic variants are linked to higher risk of many diseases, but they  may also be associated with some health advantages. Finally, we use genetic  variants associated with waist-to-hip ratio as a tool to show that central  obesity is causally associated with increased liver iron content.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal adverse effects occur in 20-30\% of patients with metformin-treated type 2 diabetes, leading to premature discontinuation in 5-10\%  of the cases. Gastrointestinal intolerance may reflect localized high  concentrations of metformin in the gut. We hypothesized that reduced transport of  metformin via the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) and organic cation  transporter 1 (OCT1) could increase the risk of severe gastrointestinal adverse  effects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 286 severe  metformin-intolerant and 1,128 metformin-tolerant individuals from the IMI DIRECT  (Innovative Medicines Initiative: DIabetes REsearCh on patient straTification)  consortium. We assessed the association of patient characteristics, concomitant  medication, and the burden of mutations in the SLC29A4 and SLC22A1 genes on odds  of intolerance. RESULTS: Women (P {\textless} 0.001) and older people (P {\textless} 0.001) were more  likely to develop metformin intolerance. Concomitant use of  transporter-inhibiting drugs increased the odds of intolerance (odds ratio [OR]  1.72, P {\textless} 0.001). In an adjusted logistic regression model, the G allele at  rs3889348 (SLC29A4) was associated with gastrointestinal intolerance (OR 1.34, P  = 0.005). rs3889348 is the top cis-expression quantitative trait locus for  SLC29A4 in gut tissue where carriers of the G allele had reduced expression.  Homozygous carriers of the G allele treated with transporter-inhibiting drugs had  more than three times higher odds of intolerance compared with carriers of no G  allele and not treated with inhibiting drugs (OR 3.23, P {\textless} 0.001). Use of a  genetic risk score derived from rs3889348 and SLC22A1 variants found that the  odds of intolerance were more than twice as high in individuals who carry three  or more risk alleles compared with those carrying none (OR 2.15, P = 0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intestinal metformin transporters and  concomitant medications play an important role in the gastrointestinal adverse  effects of metformin.},
