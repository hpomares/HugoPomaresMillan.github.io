	abstract = {Oxysterols are metabolites of cholesterol that regulate the homeostasis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and glucose. These metabolites are generated throughout  the body, either enzymatically or from oxidative stress, and are detectable in  peripheral circulation. We previously reported that circulating  27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), an endogenous selective estrogen receptor  modulator, may be a risk factor for colorectal adenomas. Here, in addition to  27-OHC, we report on four other circulating oxysterols: 25-hydroxycholesterol,  24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 7ɑ-hydroxycholesterol, and 4β-hydroxycholesterol.  Oxysterol concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography/mass  spectrometry from fasting plasma collected at baseline from 1,246 participants of  the Vitamin D/Calcium Polyp Prevention Study, a multicenter adenoma  chemoprevention trial. To evaluate multiple oxysterols simultaneously, we used  both log-linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression models  developed for analyses of complex mixtures adjusted for potential confounding  factors. Higher circulating 7ɑ-hydroxycholesterol was associated with higher  adenoma risk (Bayesian kernel machine regression-based multivariable-adjusted  risk ratios (RR; for the 75th vs. 25th percentile, 1.22; 95\% credible interval,  CI, 1.04-1.42). In contrast, higher circulating 4β-hydroxycholesterol was  associated with lower risk of these polyps (RR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.99). The  positive association with advanced adenoma risk that we previously reported for  circulating 27-OHC persisted when controlling for other oxysterols (RR, 1.26; 95\%  CI, 0.98-1.62), including among those with advanced adenomas at baseline (RR,  1.75; 95\% CI, 1.01-3.06). Prevention Relevance: Circulating concentrations of  multiple oxysterols measured at the time of an initial colorectal adenoma  diagnosis may be risk factors for subsequent incidence of these lesions. Novel  colorectal cancer prevention strategies may target oxysterol formation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Beta-cell monogenic forms of diabetes have strong support for precision medicine. We systematically analyzed evidence for precision treatments  for GCK-related hyperglycemia, HNF1A-, HNF4A- and HNF1B-diabetes, and  mitochondrial diabetes (MD) due to m.3243 A {\textgreater} G variant, 6q24-transient neonatal  diabetes mellitus (TND) and SLC19A2-diabetes. METHODS: The search of PubMed,  MEDLINE, and Embase for individual and group level data for glycemic outcomes  using inclusion (English, original articles written after 1992) and exclusion  (VUS, multiple diabetes types, absent/aggregated treatment effect measures)  criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using NHLBI study-quality assessment  tools. Data extracted from Covidence were summarized and presented as descriptive  statistics in tables and text. RESULTS: There are 146 studies included, with only  six being experimental studies. For GCK-related hyperglycemia, the six studies  (35 individuals) assessing therapy discontinuation show no HbA1c deterioration. A  randomized trial (18 individuals per group) shows that sulfonylureas (SU) were  more effective in HNF1A-diabetes than in type 2 diabetes. Cohort and case studies  support SU's effectiveness in lowering HbA1c. Two cross-over trials (each with  15-16 individuals) suggest glinides and GLP-1 receptor agonists might be used in  place of SU. Evidence for HNF4A-diabetes is limited. Most reported patients with  HNF1B-diabetes (N = 293) and MD (N = 233) are on insulin without treatment  studies. Limited data support oral agents after relapse in 6q24-TND and for  thiamine improving glycemic control and reducing/eliminating insulin requirement  in SLC19A2-diabetes. CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence, and with moderate or  serious risk of bias, to guide monogenic diabetes treatment. Further evidence is  needed to examine the optimum treatment in monogenic subtypes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lifestyle choices, metformin, and dietary supplements may prevent GDM, but the effect of intervention characteristics has not been identified. This  review evaluated intervention characteristics to inform the implementation of GDM  prevention interventions. METHODS: Ovid, MEDLINE/PubMed, and EMBASE databases  were searched. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR)  framework was used to examine intervention characteristics (who, what, when,  where, and how). Subgroup analysis was performed by intervention characteristics.  RESULTS: 116 studies involving 40,940 participants are included. Group-based  physical activity interventions (RR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.46, 0.95) reduce the incidence  of GDM compared with individual or mixed (individual and group) delivery format  (subgroup p-value = 0.04). Physical activity interventions delivered at  healthcare facilities reduce the risk of GDM (RR 0.59; 95\% CI 0.49, 0.72)  compared with home-based interventions (subgroup p-value = 0.03). No other  intervention characteristics impact the effectiveness of all other interventions.  CONCLUSIONS: Dietary, physical activity, diet plus physical activity, metformin,  and myoinositol interventions reduce the incidence of GDM compared with control  interventions. Group and healthcare facility-based physical activity  interventions show better effectiveness in preventing GDM than individual and  community-based interventions. Other intervention characteristics (e.g.  utilization of e-health) don't impact the effectiveness of lifestyle  interventions, and thus, interventions may require consideration of the local  context.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Islet autoantibodies form the foundation for type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis and staging, but heterogeneity exists in T1D development and  presentation. We hypothesized that autoantibodies can identify heterogeneity  before, at, and after T1D diagnosis, and in response to disease-modifying  therapies. METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed and EMBASE databases  (6/14/2022) assessing 10 years of original research examining relationships  between autoantibodies and heterogeneity before, at, after diagnosis, and in  response to disease-modifying therapies in individuals at-risk or within 1 year  of T1D diagnosis. A critical appraisal checklist tool for cohort studies was  modified and used for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Here we show that 152  studies that met extraction criteria most commonly characterized heterogeneity  before diagnosis (91/152). Autoantibody type/target was most frequently examined,  followed by autoantibody number. Recurring themes included correlations of  autoantibody number, type, and titers with progression, differing phenotypes  based on order of autoantibody seroconversion, and interactions with age and  genetics. Only 44\% specifically described autoantibody assay standardization  program participation. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence most strongly supports the  application of autoantibody features to more precisely define T1D before  diagnosis. Our findings support continued use of pre-clinical staging paradigms  based on autoantibody number and suggest that additional autoantibody features,  particularly in relation to age and genetic risk, could offer more precise  stratification. To improve reproducibility and applicability of  autoantibody-based precision medicine in T1D, we propose a methods checklist for  islet autoantibody-based manuscripts which includes use of precision medicine  MeSH terms and participation in autoantibody standardization workshops.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precision medicine has the potential to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction in individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS:  We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies to  identify potentially novel prognostic factors that may improve CVD risk  prediction in T2D. Out of 9380 studies identified, 416 studies met inclusion  criteria. Outcomes were reported for 321 biomarker studies, 48 genetic marker  studies, and 47 risk score/model studies. RESULTS: Out of all evaluated  biomarkers, only 13 showed improvement in prediction performance. Results of  pooled meta-analyses, non-pooled analyses, and assessments of improvement in  prediction performance and risk of bias, yielded the highest predictive utility  for N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (high-evidence),  troponin-T (TnT) (moderate-evidence), triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index  (moderate-evidence), Genetic Risk Score for Coronary Heart Disease (GRS-CHD)  (moderate-evidence); moderate predictive utility for coronary computed tomography  angiography (low-evidence), single-photon emission computed tomography  (low-evidence), pulse wave velocity (moderate-evidence); and low predictive  utility for C-reactive protein (moderate-evidence), coronary artery calcium score  (low-evidence), galectin-3 (low-evidence), troponin-I (low-evidence), carotid  plaque (low-evidence), and growth differentiation factor-15 (low-evidence). Risk  scores showed modest discrimination, with lower performance in populations  different from the original development cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high  interest in this topic, very few studies conducted rigorous analyses to  demonstrate incremental predictive utility beyond established CVD risk factors  for T2D. The most promising markers identified were NT-proBNP, TnT, TyG and  GRS-CHD, with the highest strength of evidence for NT-proBNP. Further research is  needed to determine their clinical utility in risk stratification and management  of CVD in T2D.},

METHODS: This review  included studies published in English language from January 1st, 1990, through  September 30th, 2021, that focused on the above outcomes of interest with respect  to sociodemographic factors, lifestyle and behavioral characteristics,  traditional clinical traits, and 'omics biomarkers in the mothers and offspring  during the perinatal/postpartum periods and across the lifecourse. Studies that  did not report associations of prognostic factors with outcomes of interest among  GDM-exposed women or children were excluded. RESULTS: Here, we identified 109  publications comprising 98 observational studies and 11 randomized-controlled  trials. Findings indicate that GDM severity, maternal obesity, race/ethnicity,  and unhealthy diet and physical activity levels predict T2D and CVD in women, and  greater cardiometabolic risk in offspring. However, using the Diabetes Canada  2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines for studies, the level of evidence was low due  to potential for confounding, reverse causation, and selection biases.  CONCLUSIONS: GDM pregnancies with greater severity, as well as those accompanied  by maternal obesity, unhealthy diet, and low physical activity, as well as cases  that occur among women who identify as racial/ethnic minorities are associated  with worse cardiometabolic prognosis in mothers and offspring. However, given the  low quality of evidence, prospective studies with detailed covariate data  collection and high fidelity of follow-up are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perinatal outcomes vary for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The precise factors beyond glycemic status that may refine GDM diagnosis  remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of potential  precision markers for GDM. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed  in PubMed and EMBASE from inception to March 2022 for studies comparing perinatal  outcomes among women with GDM. We searched for precision markers in the following  categories: maternal anthropometrics, clinical/sociocultural factors,  non-glycemic biochemical markers, genetics/genomics or other -omics, and fetal  biometry. We conducted post-hoc meta-analyses of a subset of studies with data on  the association of maternal body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) with offspring  macrosomia or large-for-gestational age (LGA). RESULTS: A total of 5905  titles/abstracts were screened, 775 full-texts reviewed, and 137 studies  synthesized. Maternal anthropometrics were the most frequent risk marker.  Meta-analysis demonstrated that women with GDM and overweight/obesity vs. GDM  with normal range BMI are at higher risk of offspring macrosomia (13 studies  [n = 28,763]; odds ratio [OR] 2.65; 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.91, 3.68), and  LGA (10 studies [n = 20,070]; OR 2.23; 95\% CI 2.00, 2.49). Lipids and insulin  resistance/secretion indices were the most studied non-glycemic biochemical  markers, with increased triglycerides and insulin resistance generally associated  with greater risk of offspring macrosomia or LGA. Studies evaluating other  markers had inconsistent findings as to whether they could be used as precision  markers. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal overweight/obesity is associated with greater risk  of offspring macrosomia or LGA in women with GDM. Pregnancy insulin resistance or  hypertriglyceridemia may be useful in GDM risk stratification. Future studies  examining non-glycemic biochemical, genetic, other -omic, or sociocultural  precision markers among women with GDM are warranted.},

We undertook a systematic review to determine whether strategies to subclassify  type 2 diabetes were associated with high quality evidence, reproducible results  and improved outcomes for patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for  publications that used 'simple subclassification' approaches using simple  categorisation of clinical characteristics, or 'complex subclassification'  approaches which used machine learning or 'omics approaches in people with  established type 2 diabetes. We excluded other diabetes subtypes and those  predicting incident type 2 diabetes. We assessed quality, reproducibility and  clinical relevance of extracted full-text articles and qualitatively synthesised  a summary of subclassification approaches. RESULTS: Here we show data from 51  studies that demonstrate many simple stratification approaches, but none have  been replicated and many are not associated with meaningful clinical outcomes.  Complex stratification was reviewed in 62 studies and produced reproducible  subtypes of type 2 diabetes that are associated with outcomes. Both approaches  require a higher grade of evidence but support the premise that type 2 diabetes  can be subclassified into clinically meaningful subtypes. CONCLUSION: Critical  next steps toward clinical implementation are to test whether subtypes exist in  more diverse ancestries and whether tailoring interventions to subtypes will  improve outcomes.},

Diabetes affects hundreds of  millions of people worldwide, many of whom will develop life-threatening  complications and die prematurely. Precision medicine can potentially address  this enormous problem by accounting for heterogeneity in the etiology, clinical  presentation and pathogenesis of common forms of diabetes and risks of  complications. This second international consensus report on precision diabetes  medicine summarizes the findings from a systematic evidence review across the key  pillars of precision medicine (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis) in  four recognized forms of diabetes (monogenic, gestational, type 1, type 2). These  reviews address key questions about the translation of precision medicine  research into practice. Although not complete, owing to the vast literature on  this topic, they revealed opportunities for the immediate or near-term clinical  implementation of precision diabetes medicine; furthermore, we expose important  gaps in knowledge, focusing on the need to obtain new clinically relevant  evidence. Gaps include the need for common standards for clinical readiness,  including consideration of cost-effectiveness, health equity, predictive  accuracy, liability and accessibility.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 1 in 7 pregnancies globally. It is associated with short- and long-term risks for both  mother and baby. Therefore, optimizing treatment to effectively treat the  condition has wide-ranging beneficial effects. However, despite the known  heterogeneity in GDM, treatment guidelines and approaches are generally  standardized. We hypothesized that a precision medicine approach could be a tool  for risk-stratification of women to streamline successful GDM management. With  the relatively short timeframe available to treat GDM, commencing effective  therapy earlier, with more rapid normalization of hyperglycaemia, could have  benefits for both mother and fetus. METHODS: We conducted two systematic reviews,  to identify precision markers that may predict effective lifestyle and  pharmacological interventions. RESULTS: There was a paucity of studies examining  precision lifestyle-based interventions for GDM highlighting the pressing need  for further research in this area. We found a number of precision markers  identified from routine clinical measures that may enable earlier identification  of those requiring escalation of pharmacological therapy (to metformin,  sulphonylureas or insulin). This included previous history of GDM, Body Mass  Index and blood glucose concentrations at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical  measurements at diagnosis could potentially be used as precision markers in the  treatment of GDM. Whether there are other sensitive markers that could be  identified using more complex individual-level data, such as omics, and if these  can feasibly be implemented in clinical practice remains unknown. These will be  important to consider in future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. Prevention efforts have focused on immune  modulation and supporting beta cell health before or around diagnosis; however,  heterogeneity in disease progression and therapy response has limited translation  to clinical practice, highlighting the need for precision medicine approaches to  T1D disease modification. METHODS: To understand the state of knowledge in this  area, we performed a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials with ≥50  participants cataloged in PubMed or Embase from the past 25 years testing T1D  disease-modifying therapies and/or identifying features linked to treatment  response, analyzing bias using a Cochrane-risk-of-bias instrument. RESULTS: We  identify and summarize 75 manuscripts, 15 describing 11 prevention trials for  individuals with increased risk for T1D, and 60 describing treatments aimed at  preventing beta cell loss at disease onset. Seventeen interventions, mostly  immunotherapies, show benefit compared to placebo (only two prior to T1D onset).  Fifty-seven studies employ precision analyses to assess features linked to  treatment response. Age, beta cell function measures, and immune phenotypes are  most frequently tested. However, analyses are typically not prespecified, with  inconsistent methods of reporting, and tend to report positive findings.  CONCLUSIONS: While the quality of prevention and intervention trials is overall  high, the low quality of precision analyses makes it difficult to draw meaningful  conclusions that inform clinical practice. To facilitate precision medicine  approaches to T1D prevention, considerations for future precision studies include  the incorporation of uniform outcome measures, reproducible biomarkers, and  prespecified, fully powered precision analyses into future trial design.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A precision medicine approach in type 2 diabetes requires the identification of clinical and biological features that are reproducibly  associated with differences in clinical outcomes with specific  anti-hyperglycaemic therapies. Robust evidence of such treatment effect  heterogeneity could support more individualized clinical decisions on optimal  type 2 diabetes therapy. METHODS: We performed a pre-registered systematic review  of meta-analysis studies, randomized control trials, and observational studies  evaluating clinical and biological features associated with heterogenous  treatment effects for SGLT2-inhibitor and GLP1-receptor agonist therapies,  considering glycaemic, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes. After screening 5,686  studies, we included 101 studies of SGLT2-inhibitors and 75 studies of  GLP1-receptor agonists in the final systematic review. RESULTS: Here we show that  the majority of included papers have methodological limitations precluding robust  assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity. For SGLT2-inhibitors, multiple  observational studies suggest lower renal function as a predictor of lesser  glycaemic response, while markers of reduced insulin secretion predict lesser  glycaemic response with GLP1-receptor agonists. For both therapies, multiple  post-hoc analyses of randomized control trials (including trial meta-analysis)  identify minimal clinically relevant treatment effect heterogeneity for  cardiovascular and renal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence on treatment  effect heterogeneity for SGLT2-inhibitor and GLP1-receptor agonist therapies is  limited, likely reflecting the methodological limitations of published studies.  Robust and appropriately powered studies are required to understand type 2  diabetes treatment effect heterogeneity and evaluate the potential for precision  medicine to inform future clinical care.},

METHODS: Pubmed and Embase databases were searched  (1990-2022) using inclusion/exclusion criteria for studies that sequenced one or  more monogenic diabetes genes in at least 100 probands (Question 1), evaluated a  non-obsolete genetic testing method to diagnose monogenic diabetes (Question 2).  The risk of bias was assessed using the revised QUADAS-2 tool. Existing  guidelines were summarized for questions 3-5, and review of studies for questions  6-7, supplemented by expert recommendations. Results were summarized in tables  and informed recommendations for clinical practice. RESULTS: There are 100, 32,  36, and 14 studies included for questions 1, 2, 6, and 7 respectively. On this  basis, four recommendations for who to test and five on how to test for monogenic  diabetes are provided. Existing guidelines for variant curation and gene-disease  validity curation are summarized. Reporting by gene names is recommended as an  alternative to the term MODY. Key steps after making a genetic diagnosis and  major gaps in our current knowledge are highlighted.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precision prevention involves using the unique characteristics of a particular group to determine their responses to preventive interventions. This  study aimed to systematically evaluate the participant characteristics associated  with responses to interventions in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)  prevention. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Pubmed to identify  lifestyle (diet, physical activity, or both), metformin, myoinositol/inositol and  probiotics interventions of GDM prevention published up to May 24, 2022. RESULTS:  From 10347 studies, 116 studies (n = 40940 women) are included. Physical activity  results in greater GDM reduction in participants with a normal body mass index  (BMI) at baseline compared to obese BMI (risk ratio, 95\% confidence interval:  0.06 [0.03, 0.14] vs 0.68 [0.26, 1.60]). Combined diet and physical activity  interventions result in greater GDM reduction in participants without polycystic  ovary syndrome (PCOS) than those with PCOS (0.62 [0.47, 0.82] vs 1.12  [0.78-1.61]) and in those without a history of GDM than those with unspecified  GDM history (0.62 [0.47, 0.81] vs 0.85 [0.76, 0.95]). Metformin interventions are  more effective in participants with PCOS than those with unspecified status (0.38  [0.19, 0.74] vs 0.59 [0.25, 1.43]), or when commenced preconception than during  pregnancy (0.21 [0.11, 0.40] vs 1.15 [0.86-1.55]). Parity, history of having a  large-for-gestational-age infant or family history of diabetes have no effect on  intervention responses. CONCLUSIONS: GDM prevention through metformin or  lifestyle differs according to some individual characteristics. Future research  should include trials commencing preconception and provide results disaggregated  by a priori defined participant characteristics including social and  environmental factors, clinical traits, and other novel risk factors to predict  GDM prevention through interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The greatest change in the treatment of people living with type 1 diabetes in the last decade has been the explosion of technology assisting in all  aspects of diabetes therapy, from glucose monitoring to insulin delivery and  decision making. As such, the aim of our systematic review was to assess the  utility of these technologies as well as identify any precision medicine-directed  findings to personalize care. METHODS: Screening of 835 peer-reviewed articles  was followed by systematic review of 70 of them (focusing on randomized trials  and extension studies with ≥50 participants from the past 10 years). RESULTS: We  find that novel technologies, ranging from continuous glucose monitoring systems,  insulin pumps and decision support tools to the most advanced hybrid closed loop  systems, improve important measures like HbA1c, time in range, and glycemic  variability, while reducing hypoglycemia risk. Several studies included  person-reported outcomes, allowing assessment of the burden or benefit of the  technology in the lives of those with type 1 diabetes, demonstrating positive  results or, at a minimum, no increase in self-care burden compared with standard  care. Important limitations of the trials to date are their small size, the  scarcity of pre-planned or powered analyses in sub-populations such as children,  racial/ethnic minorities, people with advanced complications, and variations in  baseline glycemic levels. In addition, confounders including education with  device initiation, concomitant behavioral modifications, and frequent contact  with the healthcare team are rarely described in enough detail to assess their  impact. CONCLUSIONS: Our review highlights the potential of technology in the  treatment of people living with type 1 diabetes and provides suggestions for  optimization of outcomes and areas of further study for precision  medicine-directed technology use in type 1 diabetes.},

We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the evidence to  support whether sociodemographic, clinical, behavioral, and molecular factors  modify the efficacy of dietary or lifestyle interventions to prevent T2D.  METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies  reporting on the effect of a lifestyle, dietary pattern, or dietary supplement  interventions on the incidence of T2D and reporting the results stratified by any  effect modifier. We extracted relevant statistical findings and qualitatively  synthesized the evidence for each modifier based on the direction of findings  reported in available studies. We used the Diabetes Canada Clinical Practice  Scale to assess the certainty of the evidence for a given effect modifier.  RESULTS: The 81 publications that met our criteria for inclusion are from 33  unique trials. The evidence is low to very low to attribute variability in  intervention effectiveness to individual characteristics such as age, sex, BMI,  race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, baseline behavioral factors, or genetic  predisposition. CONCLUSIONS: We report evidence, albeit low certainty, that those  with poorer health status, particularly those with prediabetes at baseline, tend  to benefit more from T2D prevention strategies compared to healthier  counterparts.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monogenic insulin resistance (IR) includes lipodystrophy and disorders of insulin signalling. We sought to assess the effects of interventions  in monogenic IR, stratified by genetic aetiology. METHODS: Systematic review  using PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase (1 January 1987 to 23 June 2021). Studies  reporting individual-level effects of pharmacologic and/or surgical interventions  in monogenic IR were eligible. Individual data were extracted and duplicates were  removed. Outcomes were analysed for each gene and intervention, and in aggregate  for partial, generalised and all lipodystrophy. RESULTS: 10 non-randomised  experimental studies, 8 case series, and 23 case reports meet inclusion criteria,  all rated as having moderate or serious risk of bias. Metreleptin use is  associated with the lowering of triglycerides and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in all  lipodystrophy (n = 111), partial (n = 71) and generalised lipodystrophy (n = 41),  and in LMNA, PPARG, AGPAT2 or BSCL2 subgroups (n = 72,13,21 and 21 respectively).  Body Mass Index (BMI) is lowered in partial and generalised lipodystrophy, and in  LMNA or BSCL2, but not PPARG or AGPAT2 subgroups. Thiazolidinediones are  associated with improved HbA1c and triglycerides in all lipodystrophy (n = 13),  improved HbA1c in PPARG (n = 5), and improved triglycerides in LMNA (n = 7). In  INSR-related IR, rhIGF-1, alone or with IGFBP3, is associated with improved HbA1c  (n = 17). The small size or absence of other genotype-treatment combinations  preclude firm conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence guiding genotype-specific  treatment of monogenic IR is of low to very low quality. Metreleptin and  Thiazolidinediones appear to improve metabolic markers in lipodystrophy, and  rhIGF-1 appears to lower HbA1c in INSR-related IR. For other interventions, there  is insufficient evidence to assess efficacy and risks in aggregated lipodystrophy  or genetic subgroups.},

This study aimed first to identify  distinct subgroups of response in children living with overweight and obesity and  second to elucidate predictors for subclusters. METHODS: Based on the obesity  patient follow-up registry the APV (Adipositas-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation)  initiative, a total of 12,453 children and adolescents (median age: 11.5 [IQR:  9.7-13.2] years; BMI z score [BMIz]: 2.06 [IQR: 1.79-2.34]; 52.6\% girls) living  with overweight/obesity and participating in outpatient LI were studied.  Longitudinal k-means clustering was used to identify individual BMIz response  curve for up to 2 years after treatment initiation. Multinomial logistic  regression was used to elucidate predictors for cluster membership. RESULTS: A  total of 36.3\% of children and adolescents experienced "no BMIz loss." The  largest subcluster (44.8\%) achieved "moderate BMIz loss," with an average  delta-BMIz of -0.23 (IQR: -0.33 to -0.14) at study end. A total of 18.9\% had a  "pronounced BMIz loss" up to -0.61 (IQR: -0.76 to -0.49). Younger age and lower  BMIz at LI initiation, larger initial BMIz loss, and less social deprivation were  linked with higher likelihood for moderate or pronounced BMIz loss compared with  the no BMIz loss cluster (all p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the  importance of patient-tailored intervention and earlier treatment escalation in  high-risk individuals who have little chance of success.},

We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the evidence to  support whether sociodemographic, clinical, behavioral, and molecular  characteristics modify the efficacy of dietary or lifestyle interventions to  prevent T2D. Among the 80 publications that met our criteria for inclusion, the  evidence was low to very low to attribute variability in intervention  effectiveness to individual characteristics such as age, sex, BMI,  race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, baseline behavioral factors, or genetic  predisposition. We found evidence, albeit low certainty, to support conclusions  that those with poorer health status, particularly those with prediabetes at  baseline, tend to benefit more from T2D prevention strategies compared to  healthier counterparts.

In this study, we  assessed gender and race/ethnicity representation in editorial board positions in  hematology/oncology journals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Editorial leadership board  members from 60 major journals in hematology and oncology were reviewed; 54  journals were included in the final analysis. Gender and race/ethnicity were  determined based on publicly available data for Editor-in-Chief (EiC) and  Second-in-Command (SiC) (including deputy, senior, or associate editors).  Descriptive statistics and chi-squared were estimated. In the second phase of the  study, editors were emailed a 4-item survey to self-identify their demographics.  RESULTS: Out of 793 editorial board members, 72.6\% were men and 27.4\% were women.  Editorial leadership were non-Hispanic white (71.1\%) with Asian editorial board  members representing the second largest majority at 22.5\%. Women comprised only  15.9\% of the EiC positions (90\% White and 10\% Asian). Women were about half as  likely to be in the EiC position compared with men [pOR 0.47 (95\% CI, 0.23-0.95,  P = .03)]. Women represented 28.3\% of SiC editorial positions. Surgical oncology  had the lowest female representation at 2.3\%. CONCLUSION: Women and minorities  are significantly underrepresented in leadership roles on Editorial Boards in  hematology/oncology journals. Importantly, the representation of minority women  physicians in EiC positions is at an inexorable zero.},

Internal medicine residency  curricula are lacking training for cancer survivorship and SCPs. Here, we aimed  to assess the awareness and utilization of SCPs in medicine trainees. METHODS: A  pilot survey investigating awareness and experience with SCPs was distributed  among internal medicine trainees in an outpatient setting. Participants were  stratified by program type (transitional and categorical) and year of training.  Differences in proportions were tested with parametric and non-parametric tests.  RESULTS: All thirty-seven participants who were administered a survey responded;  32.4\% and 67.6\% were transitional and categorical trainees, respectively; 54\%  were PGY-1, 21.6\% PGY-2, and 24.3\% PGY-3. None of the trainees reported following  a SCP for cancer-free patients nor plans to use SCP as a source to obtain  information. Up to 78.3\% and 92.6\% of participants reported that they were not  taught about SCPs during their residency or medical school, respectively. The  most frequent barriers to discuss cancer history and SCP with their patients  were: insufficient or lack of information about SCPs (83.8\%), patients'  information as a source deemed "unreliable" (81.1\%), and uncertainty if the  patient has SCP (81.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness and use of cancer SCPs among  internal medicine trainees is limited, furthermore, a sizeable proportion  reported not having accessed or received any training for SCPs. Efforts intended  to facilitate SCP use and educate trainees about cancer survivorship may prove to  be an effective strategy to increase the quality of care to cancer survivors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 receptor agonists lower blood glucose concentrations, body weight, and have cardiovascular benefits. The  efficacy and side effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists vary between people. Human  pharmacogenomic studies of this inter-individual variation can provide both  biological insight into drug action and provide biomarkers to inform clinical  decision making. We therefore aimed to identify genetic variants associated with  glycaemic response to GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment. METHODS: In this  genome-wide analysis we included adults (aged ≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes  treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists with baseline HbA(1c) of 7\% or more (53  mmol/mol) from four prospective observational cohorts (DIRECT, PRIBA, PROMASTER,  and GoDARTS) and two randomised clinical trials (HARMONY phase 3 and AWARD). The  primary endpoint was HbA(1c) reduction at 6 months after starting GLP-1 receptor  agonists. We evaluated variants in GLP1R, then did a genome-wide association  study and gene-based burden tests. FINDINGS: 4571 adults were included in our  analysis, of these, 3339 (73\%) were White European, 449 (10\%) Hispanic, 312 (7\%)  American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 471 (10\%) were other, and around 2140  (47\%) of the participants were women. Variation in HbA(1c) reduction with GLP-1  receptor agonists treatment was associated with rs6923761G→A (Gly168Ser) in the  GLP1R (0·08\% [95\% CI 0·04-0·12] or 0·9 mmol/mol lower reduction in HbA(1c) per  serine, p=6·0 × 10(-5)) and low frequency variants in ARRB1 (optimal sequence  kernel association test p=6·7 × 10(-8)), largely driven by rs140226575G→A  (Thr370Met; 0·25\% [SE 0·06] or 2·7 mmol/mol  [SE 0·7] greater HbA(1c) reduction  per methionine, p=5·2 × 10(-6)). A similar effect size for the ARRB1 Thr370Met  was seen in Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native populations who have a  higher frequency of this variant (6-11\%) than in White European populations.  Combining these two genes identified 4\% of the population who had a 30\% greater  reduction in HbA(1c) than the 9\% of the population with the worse response.  INTERPRETATION: This genome-wide pharmacogenomic study of GLP-1 receptor agonists  provides novel biological and clinical insights. Clinically, when genotype is  routinely available at the point of prescribing, individuals with ARRB1 variants  might benefit from earlier initiation of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

	abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Excess adiposity is differentially associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease in men and women, according to observational  studies. Causal inference studies largely assume a linear relationship between  BMI and cardiometabolic outcomes, which may not be the case. In this study, we  investigated the shapes of the causal relationships between BMI and  cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors. We further investigated sex  differences within the causal framework. METHODS: To assess causal relationships  between BMI and the outcomes, we used two-stage least-squares Mendelian  randomisation (MR), with a polygenic risk score for BMI as the instrumental  variable. To elucidate the shapes of the causal relationships, we used a  non-linear MR fractional polynomial method, and used piecewise MR to investigate  threshold relationships and confirm the shapes. RESULTS: BMI was associated with  type 2 diabetes (OR 3.10; 95\% CI 2.73, 3.53), hypertension (OR 1.53; 95\% CI 1.44,  1.62) and coronary artery disease (OR 1.20; 95\% CI 1.08, 1.33), but not chronic  kidney disease (OR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.67, 1.72) or stroke (OR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.92,  1.28). The data suggest that these relationships are non-linear. For  cardiometabolic risk factors, BMI was positively associated with glucose,  HbA(1c), triacylglycerol levels and both systolic and diastolic BP. BMI had an  inverse causal relationship with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and  HDL-cholesterol. The data suggest a non-linear causal relationship between BMI  and BP and other biomarkers (p{\textless}0.001) except lipoprotein A. The piecewise MR  results were consistent with the fractional polynomial results. The causal effect  of BMI on coronary artery disease, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was  different in men and women, but this sex difference was only significant for  LDL-cholesterol after controlling for multiple testing (p{\textless}0.001). Further, the  causal effect of BMI on coronary artery disease varied by menopause status in  women. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We describe the shapes of causal effects of  BMI on cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors, and report sex differences in  the causal effects of BMI on LDL-cholesterol. We found evidence of non-linearity  in the causal effect of BMI on diseases and risk factor biomarkers. Reducing  excess adiposity is highly beneficial for health, but there is greater need to  consider biological sex in the management of adiposity.},

To estimate these  effects, intake of protein, carbohydrate, sugar, fat, and its subtypes were  obtained using food frequency data derived from a Swedish population-based cohort  (n{\textasciitilde}60,000). Data on clinical outcomes (i.e., type 2 diabetes (T2D) and  cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence) were obtained by linking health registry  data. We assessed the magnitude of direct and mediated effects of diet, adiposity  and physical activity on T2D and CVD using structural equation modelling (SEM).  To strengthen causal inference, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) to model  macronutrient intake exposures against clinical outcomes. We identified likely  causal effects of genetically predicted carbohydrate intake (including sugar  intake) and T2D, independent of adiposity and physical activity. Pairwise,  serial- and parallel-mediational configurations yielded similar results. In the  integrative genomic analyses, the candidate causal variant localized to the  established T2D gene TCF7L2.

	abstract = {The present study assessed the temporal associations of {\textasciitilde} 300 lifestyle exposures with nine cardiometabolic traits  to identify exposures/exposure groups that  might inform lifestyle interventions for the reduction of cardiometabolic  disease risk. The analyses were undertaken in a longitudinal sample  comprising {\textgreater} 31,000 adults living in northern Sweden. Linear mixed models were  used to assess the average associations of lifestyle exposures and linear  regression models were used to test associations with 10-year change in the  cardiometabolic traits. 'Physical activity' and 'General Health' were the  exposure categories containing the highest number of 'tentative signals' in  analyses assessing the average association of lifestyle variables, while 'Tobacco  use' was the top category for the 10-year change association analyses. Eleven  modifiable variables showed a consistent average association among the majority  of cardiometabolic traits. These variables belonged to the domains: (i) Smoking,  (ii) Beverage (filtered coffee), (iii) physical activity, (iv) alcohol intake,  and (v) specific variables related to Nordic lifestyle (hunting/fishing during  leisure time and boiled coffee consumption). We used an agnostic, data-driven  approach to assess a wide range of established and novel risk factors for  cardiometabolic disease. Our findings highlight key variables, along with their  respective effect estimates, that might be prioritised for subsequent prediction  models and lifestyle interventions.},

In this longitudinal study, participants (N = 2,111)  underwent a 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and 48  months. HbA(1c) was also measured. We classified participants as having isolated  prediabetes defect (impaired fasting glucose [IFG], impaired glucose tolerance  [IGT], or HbA(1c) indicative of prediabetes [IA1c]), two defects (IFG+IGT,  IFG+IA1c, or IGT+IA1c), or all defects (IFG+IGT+IA1c). β-Cell function (BCF) and  insulin sensitivity were assessed from OGTT. At baseline, in pooling of  participants with isolated defects, they showed impairment in both BCF and  insulin sensitivity compared with healthy control subjects. Pooled groups with  two or three defects showed progressive further deterioration. Among groups with  isolated defect, those with IGT showed lower insulin sensitivity, insulin  secretion at reference glucose (ISR(r)), and insulin secretion potentiation (P {\textless}  0.002). Conversely, those with IA1c showed higher insulin sensitivity and ISR(r)  (P {\textless} 0.0001). Among groups with two defects, we similarly found differences in  both BCF and insulin sensitivity. At 48 months, we found higher type 2 diabetes  incidence for progressively increasing number of prediabetes defects (odds ratio  {\textgreater}2, P {\textless} 0.008). In conclusion, the prediabetes groups showed differences in  type/degree of glucometabolic impairment. Compared with the pooled group with  isolated defects, those with double or triple defect showed progressive  differences in diabetes incidence.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the processes underlying glycemic deterioration in type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 732 recently  diagnosed patients with T2D from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Diabetes  Research on Patient Stratification (IMI DIRECT) study were extensively phenotyped  over 3 years, including measures of insulin sensitivity (OGIS), β-cell glucose  sensitivity (GS), and insulin clearance (CLIm) from mixed meal tests, liver  enzymes, lipid profiles, and baseline regional fat from MRI. The associations  between the longitudinal metabolic patterns and HbA(1c) deterioration, adjusted  for changes in BMI and in diabetes medications, were assessed via stepwise  multivariable linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: Faster HbA(1c) progression  was independently associated with faster deterioration of OGIS and GS and  increasing CLIm; visceral or liver fat, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides had  further independent, though weaker, roles (R (2) = 0.38). A subgroup of patients  with a markedly higher progression rate (fast progressors) was clearly  distinguishable considering these variables only (discrimination capacity from  area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.94). The proportion of fast  progressors was reduced from 56\% to 8-10\% in subgroups in which only one trait  among OGIS, GS, and CLIm was relatively stable (odds ratios 0.07-0.09). T2D  polygenic risk score and baseline pancreatic fat, glucagon-like peptide 1,  glucagon, diet, and physical activity did not show an independent role.  CONCLUSIONS: Deteriorating insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, increasing  insulin clearance, high visceral or liver fat, and worsening of the lipid profile  are the crucial factors mediating glycemic deterioration of patients with T2D in  the initial phase of the disease. Stabilization of a single trait among insulin  sensitivity, β-cell function, and insulin clearance may be relevant to prevent  progression.},

	abstract = {The serum metabolome contains a plethora of biomarkers and causative agents of various diseases, some of which are endogenously produced and some that have been  taken up from the environment(1). The origins of specific compounds are known,  including metabolites that are highly heritable(2,3), or those that are  influenced by the gut microbiome(4), by lifestyle choices such as smoking(5), or  by diet(6). However, the key determinants of most metabolites are still poorly  understood. Here we measured the levels of 1,251 metabolites in serum samples  from a unique and deeply phenotyped healthy human cohort of 491 individuals. We  applied machine-learning algorithms to predict metabolite levels in held-out  individuals on the basis of host genetics, gut microbiome, clinical parameters,  diet, lifestyle and anthropometric measurements, and obtained statistically  significant predictions for more than 76\% of the profiled metabolites. Diet and  microbiome had the strongest predictive power, and each explained hundreds of  metabolites-in some cases, explaining more than 50\% of the observed variance. We  further validated microbiome-related predictions by showing a high replication  rate in two geographically independent cohorts(7,8) that were not available to us  when we trained the algorithms. We used feature attribution analysis(9) to reveal  specific dietary and bacterial interactions. We further demonstrate that some of  these interactions might be causal, as some metabolites that we predicted to be  positively associated with bread were found to increase after a randomized  clinical trial of bread intervention. Overall, our results reveal potential  determinants of more than 800 metabolites, paving the way towards a mechanistic  understanding of alterations in metabolites under different conditions and to  designing interventions for manipulating the levels of circulating metabolites.},

Here we report a causal inference analysis investigating the effects of  prediabetes in coronary artery disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease,  complemented by a systematic review of relevant observational studies. Although  the observational studies suggest that prediabetes is broadly associated with  diabetes complications, the causal inference analysis revealed that prediabetes  is only causally related with coronary artery disease, with no evidence of causal  effects on other diabetes complications. In conclusion, prediabetes likely causes  coronary artery disease and its prevention is likely to be most effective if  initiated prior to the onset of diabetes.},

This has helped raise awareness of the tremendous  burden the disease places on individuals and societies; it has also identified  key risk factors that have become the focus of diabetes prevention trials and  helped shape public health recommendations. Recent developments in affordable  high-throughput genetic and molecular phenotyping technologies have driven the  emergence of a new type of epidemiology with a more mechanistic focus than ever  before. Studies employing these technologies have identified gene variants or  causal loci, and linked these to other omics data that help define the molecular  processes mediating the effects of genetic variation in the expression of  clinical phenotypes. The scale of these epidemiological studies is rapidly  growing; a trend that is set to continue as the public and private sectors invest  heavily in omics data generation. Many are banking on this massive volume of  diverse molecular data for breakthroughs in drug discovery and predicting  sensitivity to risk factors, response to therapies and susceptibility to diabetes  complications, as well as the development of disease-monitoring tools and  surrogate outcomes. To realise these possibilities, it is essential that omics  technologies are applied to well-designed epidemiological studies and that the  emerging data are carefully analysed and interpreted. One might view this as  next-generation epidemiology, where complex high-dimensionality data analysis  approaches will need to be blended with many of the core principles of  epidemiological research. In this article, we review the literature on omics in  diabetes epidemiology and discuss how this field is evolving. Graphical abstract.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent and causes serious health complications in individuals with and without type 2  diabetes (T2D). Early diagnosis of NAFLD is important, as this can help prevent  irreversible damage to the liver and, ultimately, hepatocellular carcinomas. We  sought to expand etiological understanding and develop a diagnostic tool for  NAFLD using machine learning. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We utilized the baseline data  from IMI DIRECT, a multicenter prospective cohort study of 3,029  European-ancestry adults recently diagnosed with T2D (n = 795) or at high risk of  developing the disease (n = 2,234). Multi-omics (genetic, transcriptomic,  proteomic, and metabolomic) and clinical (liver enzymes and other serological  biomarkers, anthropometry, measures of beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity,  and lifestyle) data comprised the key input variables. The models were trained on  MRI-image-derived liver fat content ({\textless}5\% or ≥5\%) available for 1,514  participants. We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)  to select features from the different layers of omics data and random forest  analysis to develop the models. The prediction models included clinical and omics  variables separately or in combination. A model including all omics and clinical  variables yielded a cross-validated receiver operating characteristic area under  the curve (ROCAUC) of 0.84 (95\% CI 0.82, 0.86; p {\textless} 0.001), which compared with a  ROCAUC of 0.82 (95\% CI 0.81, 0.83; p {\textless} 0.001) for a model including 9 clinically  accessible variables. The IMI DIRECT prediction models outperformed existing  noninvasive NAFLD prediction tools. One limitation is that these analyses were  performed in adults of European ancestry residing in northern Europe, and it is  unknown how well these findings will translate to people of other ancestries and  exposed to environmental risk factors that differ from those of the present  cohort. Another key limitation of this study is that the prediction was done on a  binary outcome of liver fat quantity ({\textless}5\% or ≥5\%) rather than a continuous one.  CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed several models with different  combinations of clinical and omics data and identified biological features that  appear to be associated with liver fat accumulation. In general, the clinical  variables showed better prediction ability than the complex omics variables.  However, the combination of omics and clinical variables yielded the highest  accuracy. We have incorporated the developed clinical models into a web interface  (see: https://www.predictliverfat.org/) and made it available to the community.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Excess liver iron content is common and is linked to the risk of hepatic and extrahepatic diseases. We aimed to identify genetic variants  influencing liver iron content and use genetics to understand its link to other  traits and diseases. METHODS: First, we performed a genome-wide association study  (GWAS) in 8,289 individuals from UK Biobank, whose liver iron level had been  quantified by magnetic resonance imaging, before validating our findings in an  independent cohort (n = 1,513 from IMI DIRECT). Second, we used Mendelian  randomisation to test the causal effects of 25 predominantly metabolic traits on  liver iron content. Third, we tested phenome-wide associations between liver iron  variants and 770 traits and disease outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 3  independent genetic variants (rs1800562 [C282Y] and rs1799945 [H63D] in HFE and  rs855791 [V736A] in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron content that reached the  GWAS significance threshold (p {\textless}5 × 10(-8)). The 2 HFE variants account for ∼85\%  of all cases of hereditary haemochromatosis. Mendelian randomisation analysis  provided evidence that higher central obesity plays a causal role in increased  liver iron content. Phenome-wide association analysis demonstrated shared  aetiopathogenic mechanisms for elevated liver iron, high blood pressure,  cirrhosis, malignancies, neuropsychiatric and rheumatological conditions, while  also highlighting inverse associations with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic  heart disease. CONCLUSION: Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms  underlying higher liver iron content are likely systemic rather than organ  specific, that higher central obesity is causally associated with higher liver  iron, and that liver iron shares common aetiology with multiple metabolic and  non-metabolic diseases. LAY SUMMARY: Excess liver iron content is common and is  associated with liver diseases and metabolic diseases including diabetes, high  blood pressure, and heart disease. We identified 3 genetic variants that are  linked to an increased risk of developing higher liver iron content. We show that  the same genetic variants are linked to higher risk of many diseases, but they  may also be associated with some health advantages. Finally, we use genetic  variants associated with waist-to-hip ratio as a tool to show that central  obesity is causally associated with increased liver iron content.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal adverse effects occur in 20-30\% of patients with metformin-treated type 2 diabetes, leading to premature discontinuation in 5-10\%  of the cases. Gastrointestinal intolerance may reflect localized high  concentrations of metformin in the gut. We hypothesized that reduced transport of  metformin via the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) and organic cation  transporter 1 (OCT1) could increase the risk of severe gastrointestinal adverse  effects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 286 severe  metformin-intolerant and 1,128 metformin-tolerant individuals from the IMI DIRECT  (Innovative Medicines Initiative: DIabetes REsearCh on patient straTification)  consortium. We assessed the association of patient characteristics, concomitant  medication, and the burden of mutations in the SLC29A4 and SLC22A1 genes on odds  of intolerance. RESULTS: Women (P {\textless} 0.001) and older people (P {\textless} 0.001) were more  likely to develop metformin intolerance. Concomitant use of  transporter-inhibiting drugs increased the odds of intolerance (odds ratio [OR]  1.72, P {\textless} 0.001). In an adjusted logistic regression model, the G allele at  rs3889348 (SLC29A4) was associated with gastrointestinal intolerance (OR 1.34, P  = 0.005). rs3889348 is the top cis-expression quantitative trait locus for  SLC29A4 in gut tissue where carriers of the G allele had reduced expression.  Homozygous carriers of the G allele treated with transporter-inhibiting drugs had  more than three times higher odds of intolerance compared with carriers of no G  allele and not treated with inhibiting drugs (OR 3.23, P {\textless} 0.001). Use of a  genetic risk score derived from rs3889348 and SLC22A1 variants found that the  odds of intolerance were more than twice as high in individuals who carry three  or more risk alleles compared with those carrying none (OR 2.15, P = 0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intestinal metformin transporters and  concomitant medications play an important role in the gastrointestinal adverse  effects of metformin.},
