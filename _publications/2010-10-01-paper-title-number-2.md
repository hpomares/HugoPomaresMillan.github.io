	abstract = {People appear to vary in their susceptibility to lifestyle risk factors for cardiometabolic disease; determining a priori who is most sensitive may help  optimize the timing, design, and delivery of preventative interventions. We aimed  to ascertain a person's degree of resilience or sensitivity to adverse lifestyle  exposures and determine whether these classifications help predict  cardiometabolic disease later in life; we pooled data from two population-based  Swedish prospective cohort studies (n = 53,507), and we contrasted an  individual's cardiometabolic biomarker profile with the profile predicted for  them given their lifestyle exposure characteristics using a quantile random  forest approach. People who were classed as 'sensitive' to hypertension- and  dyslipidemia-related lifestyle exposures were at higher risk of developing  cardiovascular disease (CVD, hazards ratio 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.3, 1.91)), compared  with the general population. No differences were observed for type 2 diabetes  (T2D) risk. Here, we report a novel approach to identify individuals who are  especially sensitive to adverse lifestyle exposures and who are at higher risk of  subsequent cardiovascular events. Early preventive interventions may be needed in  this subgroup.},
